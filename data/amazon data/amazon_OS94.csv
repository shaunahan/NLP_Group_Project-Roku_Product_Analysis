1009,1008,R39YWYM402IOAH,Love It!,I recently upgraded my tv to 4K. I’ve always had Apple TV but wasn’t ready to spend $200 on Apple 4K TV. I’ve always heard that Roku was good so 12ided that for $80 I would give it a try. It arrived quickly and was a breeze to set up. After going thru the initial set-up ( I really missed being able to use my iPhone or iPad to log in to everything) I was streaming. And I fell in love! The interface is very easy to navigate and I can still get my Apple TV channel.

1027,1027,R24BKLMIP7I627,Better than expected. Sharp clear quick and s03t.,"This is my first streamer. I am very happy with it. I recently switched to at&t tv, and there is no app for my s03t TV. I wanted this so I don't have to cast from my phone or tablet to the TV. It works great. I now have the best sound and picture available from whatever I am watching or listening to. And everything is consolidated into one device. I have a surround sound system and was tired of only having stereo from my source. I also don't like fake surround if the source is only stereo. Through the roku settings I'm able to passthrough the sound to my receiver. That way I get the sound that is intended for the program. I have a 4k hdr TV, so I had to change the settings on the roku to 4k uhd otherwise it was forcing dolbyvision on for everything. If I watch a true dolbyvision source, I have to change it back. The menu system is fast. The voice search is nice, and it searches all sources and gives you the price of all of them. Very handy in today's messed up media world. Eg. If you search for a movie, it will tell you what platforms its available on, and in what format, then you just pick the one that you already subscribe to, or if you aren't subscribed, you can rent or buy, right on the roku. I haven't plugged in ethernet yet, but haven't seen any buffering or lag issues. My router is very close to the router though, ymmv. This was about $25 less than the at&t streamer, and I can't imagine that being this good. I highly recommend this roku. I didn't realize how many subscriptions we have until I logged into them all. It's awesome to have them all in the same place, and not to have to search around for the best source, or price if you want to watch a movie.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24BKLMIP7I627/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,4,O.S. 9.4,love it it works great and is easy to set up just follow the prompts,love works great easy set follow prompts,love work great easi set follow prompt

1113,1113,R2U9SGGRTYV9B6,Buy this! Don't believe the negative reviews,"I bought my first Ultra on a sale from Wal03t. It was the first Roku device i purchased. It makes streaming a breeze. I used it with a yamaha receiver and a Epson 5050ub. Watching anything 4k or HD with this setup has been amazing! Netflix, Disney plus, Amazon Prime, Youtube, HBO Max, Hotstar - these are just some of the ""channels"" available and they all work flawlessly. Ive tried the included headphones with the remote which are pretty basic but using a great pair of Sennheiser over the ear headphones made for a much better experience. I've seen people complain that their bluetooth headphones didn't work. To them i say - don't bother. It's nearly impossible to eliminate the lag that comes from introducing bluetooth into the mix. You are setting yourself up for a lousy experience. It was so easy to use i moved the device to our living room TV so we weren't using the PS4 for streaming services any more. This device makes watching what you want to a breeze. I then made the mistake of buying the Roku premier because i mistakenly thought that all i would lose is the headphone jack on the remote. After using the Ultra I hated the Premier. The user experience with the Ultra is far SUPERIOR compared to the Premier Things i like about the Ultra: 1 - it turns on/off my tv/projector/receiver with one click 2 - no need to point the remote at the unit. 3 - 'find the remote' button 4 - ethernet port for wired connection 5 - volume control on the remote to control the TV or Receivers volume 6 - headphones jack on the remote for private listening The Premier gives you the same 4k capabilities and the same channels etc. But the features i mentioned above just make for a much better user experience. Each of those points by themselves is a damn big deal. Put together it makes the Premier a product that should not have been made. I noticed that the folks who are leaving negative reviews generally have some particular exceptional condition in there setup that they can't get around or makes thier user experience less than stellar. But for a majority of users out there this product will leave you expecting nothing less from any other streaming device out there. I just bought a second unit. The Premier will be relegated to the tv in front of the treadmill - where, like the treadmill, it will be rarely used. Buy the Ultra - especially if you see a price drop. It's worth it and you won't be disappointed.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U9SGGRTYV9B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,False,,2021,3,O.S. 9.4,it would be great except my stereo does not support dolby digital plus mine only supports dolby digital and the roku does not allow the dd to pass surround to dd i have a firetv k and it has no problem giving me surround sound from the same apps the roku is collecting dust now if i had known this ahead of time i would have purchased another firetv,would great except stereo support dolby digital plus mine supports dolby digital allow dd pass surround dd firetv k problem giving surround sound apps collecting dust known ahead time would purchased another firetv,would great except stereo support dolbi digit plu mine support dolbi digit allow dd pass surround dd firetv k problem give surround sound app collect dust known ahead time would purchas anoth firetv

connection inside the cabinet under the tv i prefer to have tvs connected using ethernet so as to reduce the traffic on my wifi this product has both wifi and ethernet so a big plus there installing the roku was easy my hdmi cables were already in place i really enjoyed replacing the huge heavy and very warm cable box good riddance with the ethernet connection the install is rather boring i plugged it in and was left to complete the installation using the remote the next part of the install was to set up the tvs p screen and the remote my tv is p and the device discovered that and set it automatically i was very pleased that roku remote can power and set the sound natively without having to use the tv s remote after years of using multiple remotes and the kludgy cabletv remote it all works as one i m particularly pleased that since appletv and airplay are supported that knocks another remote to the curb going through the device setup is easy and roku will ask questions about your preferences in order to tailor some of the apps channels it puts on your home screen it takes a few minutes and is very straightforward one thing that i really love about this roku is the remote it has the voice control works great to turn on and off subtitles or switch channels for example and a headphone jack for private listening honestly the most satisfying part of the remote is it s feel it is a bit weightier than the roku remotes i got with my roku tvs and just feels great in my hand i wish roku made the tv manufacturers using the roku os also use the nicer remote i just love the remote even if first timers always ask how to change the volume finally using this as a reason to get deep into the tv cabinet and behind the tv i was amazed how heavy and dusty that tv is the newer tvs are

1121,1121,R2EU85RET3578M,The most annoying and dysfunctional system ever,"First off, I purchased the more expensive ROKU Ultra thinking that it would offer features that are worth it. What I got was a system that on day two of usage did the most maddening things. The audio would go off in the middle of a show although the close captioning would remain. Then the it would come back on for no apparent reason before cutting out again. Then it would only be loud and annoying static. Turning the Roku off and on again would solve the problem but only for minutes before happening again. Then the video would go off and the various video settings like 4:3,16:9, Wide Zoom, 1080p HD, HDMI would endlessly scroll on the TV instead of the actual show. Then unexpectedly it would be normal again. This thing is maddening. I checked the internet and a lot of folks that purchased the UROKU Ultra are having the same problem and getting no help from ROKU. Let me say my WiFi is top of the line 5G Comcast and my ROKU firmware is up to date. This thing quite honestly is the worse product going.

This issue still happens from time to time on the Roku Express on a particular show but not as often as the Roku Ultra. The Ultra's remote also often stopped working. No button I pushed would work. I did try to restart the Roku Ultra each time I had major problems but that didn't fix it. After reading many reviews it seems like Roku has many problems with their remote controls.

1151,1151,R3169LP44EAIL0,Constant HDCP 2.2 Error Messages that Roku Refuses to Resolve,"I have a new Roku Ultra connected to a new LG OLED77CXPUA 4K S03t TV using a brand new Monster brand HDMI cable in HDMI port 1. I also have a new Samsung HW-T550 sound bar attached to the same LG OLED77CXPUS S03t TV connected to HDMI port 2 using another new Monster brand HDMI cable. This setup provides audio via the HDMI ARC feature. All devices are at their latest firmware /software code levels available. I have YouTube TV as my pri03y streaming service and programs that I am watching are constantly being interrupted by this HDCP 2.2 error message which blocks viewing the program content but continues the audio when it appears (see picture of error). Sometimes the error message flashes on then off and resumes the programs viewing. Other times the error message comes on and stays on forcing me to completely back out of YouTube TV to the Roku's main menu. If I click to launch YouTube TV again and launch a recorded or live program, the error message reappears. This is ridiculous. It doesn't happen outside of the Roku. If I use the LG OLED TV's own S03t menu and launch YouTube TV from there, YTTV runs flawlessly. Its only when using the Roku. I have been dealing with this HDCP 2.2 error message even before I replaced my 2013 Samsung UN65ES8000 65"" S03t TV with the LG OLED and replaced the 2013 Samsung HW-T450 with the 2020 HW-T550. The presented error message provides steps on how to resolve the issue but these steps only provided a temporary relief. Roku needs to fix this issue permanently. Read any Roku community forum or Reddit Roku forum and there are multiple posts of customers with this same issue and Roku just offers a def tone response to this issue by repeating the steps outlined in the error itself. This frustrating and unacceptable. I have also replaced the Roku Ultra with a new one hoping that it would fix the issue and it didn't.

At the time television was FREE, then somehow when the satellite/cable providers entered the 03ket the public was paying for television and still had to stomach commercials, it can be argued that the providers needed to recoup cost of infrastructure etc, but not my deal...if I am going to watch commercials the tv should be free, if I am paying for TV then no commercials period, so in that light with the ability to a la carte the types of content you wish to watch on a streaming channel...the Roku is such a cool deal...ditching the approx $90/month satellite for the 1 time cost of a Roku and then (2) services that combined are approx $18/month...no commercials...and all on demand. ....Easy 12ision to buy the Roku for me.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26AYADQYB5O5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,6.0,2021,3,O.S. 9.4,easy to install and easy to upload though i did have to get someone under the age of to explain some stuff to me,easy install easy upload though get someone age explain stuff,easi instal easi upload though get someon age explain stuff

This ROKU ultra will not play any material on its menu. All I get is either a purple menu or an black screen error message regarding HDCP 2.2, saying my cable and port are possibly not acceptable. I have to unplug all cables and power cords and start over which did no help. HDCP 2.2 is new copyright protection software/port/plugs. I checked my cables, changed the settings to 1080, checked each HDMI port no luck. The issue is the Roku Ultra. How did I discover this? My old ROKU gets discovery plus with no problems, no port issue, no cable issue, and no settings issue. Old ROKU (2015) works great. It seems that the Roku Ultra has a bug or its copyright protection software has a setting so sensitive that one cannot watch anything on it.

receiver to accommodate when it s working perfectly the video quality is great and the dd sound is a step up from the standard i was getting using an optical cable connection between tv and a v receiver however the roku hardware firmware whatever does leave several things to be desired not so good as others have noted i will not infrequently get kicked out of an app mid stream and shunted to the roku home page this normally doesn t happen more than once per night per app but it does happen at least once per viewing session i am usually able to resume the video somewhat close to where i was booted i have restarted the device several times since first install it does not seem to address this issue not as not infrequently the roku will freeze entirely during which time the buttons on the remote do nothing for up to a minute this generally stops on its own i haven t yet had to unplug the power cord regarding the streaming itself i have historically believed and been proven right that a wired connection is the preferable way of hooking up any sort of streaming device initially that s how i connected the roku and i found that the rule does not seem to hold true here occasionally especially during k movies i would notice intrusive video artifacts briefly appearing on screen pixelated blocks of semi transparent green and red eventually i came to the conclusion this was a by product of the device switching between resolutions my bandwidth is mbps which should be enough for stable k streaming and my laptop in the same general location as the roku tests at full speed using either wired ethernet or ghz wireless for whatever reason connection tests run on the roku hit around mbps for wired and just slightly lower for ghz wireless despite the ostensibly slower results after connecting the roku using wireless i have noticed the visual artifacts less frequently and intrusively although they do still appear once in a while i have also since found forums with users stating their similar experiences the roku ultra s wireless connection overall seems more stable than its wired connection overall by this point in their release cycle i d have thought roku would have ironed out very noticeable user experience issues especially where basic features and performance are involved this does not seem to be the case however the roku ultra was at a discounted price when i bought it plus i had a gift card and credit for the price i paid the convenience of consolidated streaming plus for the most part high quality video and sound outweigh the performance

Seems everyone loves Roku and rightly so. Was disappointed at first as I would received random black screens with the 2.2 HDCP error that would go away after a few seconds. I had Amazon HDMI cables connecting my Denon through ARC to the LG and everywhere else, and I assumed the ""premium"" HDMI cable that Roku supplied was good. Now after reading up on the HDCP error it seems it is not as much to do with the speed of the HDMI cables and my components but its more of a ""handshake"" issue between them. I figured I would splurge the extra $8 and switch out the Roku cable for another Amazon and since then I have yet to see the HDCP again. Not sure if all the HDMI cables have to match..... but I'm happy now.

1257,1257,R210JUOBGF2NPC,Fabulous product that gave new life to my ‘older’ but excellent Sony 1080p TV,"After buying a couple of Roku TVs, and realizing how great they are, I finally 12ided to cut her cable and convert my two ‘older’ TVs. My first was a Sony that we’ve hade for a long time and I used this product because I have an Ethernet connection inside the cabinet under the TV. I prefer to have TVs connected using Ethernet so as to reduce the traffic on my WiFi. This product has both WiFi and Ethernet so a big plus there. Installing the Roku was easy, my HDMI cables were already in place. I really enjoyed replacing the huge, heavy and very warm cable box (good riddance ). With the Ethernet connection, the install is rather boring. I plugged it in and was left to complete the installation using the remote. The next part of the install was to set up the TVs 1080p screen and the remote. My TV is 1080p and the device discovered that and set it automatically. I was very pleased that Roku remote can power and set the sound natively without having to use the TV’s remote. After years of using multiple remotes and the kludgy CableTV remote, it all works as one! I’m particularly pleased that since AppleTV and AirPlay are supported, that knocks another remote to the curb. Going through the device setup is easy and Roku will ask questions about your preferences in order to tailor some of the apps/channels it puts on your Home Screen. It takes a few minutes and is very straightforward. One thing that I really love about this Roku is the remote. It has the voice control (works great to turn on and off subtitles or switch channels, for example) and a headphone jack for private listening. Honestly, the most satisfying part of the remote is it’s feel. It is a bit weightier than the Roku remotes I got with my Roku TVs and just feels great in my hand. I wish Roku made the TV manufacturers using the Roku OS also use the nicer remote. I just love the remote, even if first timers always ask how to change the volume! Finally, using this as a reason to get deep into the TV cabinet and behind the TV, I was amazed how heavy (and dusty) that TV is. The newer TVs are so light and thin! This Sony is a helluva workhorse tho, and the picture is flawless albeit 1080p. I think it will be a while before there is enough 4K or 8k programming out there to make a difference. This Roku device is a fabulous product that gave new life to my ‘older’ TV.

1262,1262,R10DR7JHAFBH1B,Avoid if you want to customize any settings,"I've used Rokus for many years. Own three others, and I generally like the system. Never had a problem with a unit as much as this one, which is part of a home theater setup. To put it simply: The Ultra will not maintain any video resolution system beyond the fullest/highest provided to it. I'm using it at a location where I mostly watch news shows. I don't need them in 4K HDR, especially now that that resolution devours broadband to the point it puts me over my ISP limit for the month. But the Roku's resolution settings keep resetting to the highest rez every time it's powered on/off. Learned an online trick to find a ""hidden"" menu that disables ""autorecovery"" which defeated this for a while. But now the Roku, which shows its Home screen and even channel grids, etc., refuses to throughput any video at 1080p, my desired setting. Black screen. Reset to 4k HDR, and it works fine. Spent hours online and phone with Roku support and they cannot solve the issue. Which makes me wonder why in the world there is a menu setting for screen resolution when the unit won't accept it? BTW it's not a flawed unit, apparently, as I returned one already and its replacement does the same thing. Which means it'll be going back, too. Nor is it my setup (in spite of much insistence from support) because I have an identical setup in another room, with a two-year old Roku Ultra, and this is not an issue. Roku has basically outlived its usefulness; pretty much everything it does is now performed capably by an even modest s03t TV.

Even though I can that it successfully sends DHCP discover packets and that DHCP offers are sent in response the Roku does not think it is connected. The two switches I tired are the HP1820 and the Netgear GS108LP POE. Meanwhile my older Roku Ultra 2018 has no issue connecting to either switch. Until now I've always been impressed with Roku products and Roku customer support but after spending an hour chatting with customer service it took 10 days for to get an unhelpful, generic response to my ticket.

1266,1266,R2GYJHY2KMWDTR,Works,The media could not be loaded. Update. I've since ordered a replacement. It makes that horrible sound until its unplugged turning the tv off does nothing. Not sure it's a compatibility issue with the surround sound or what. I had a thought last week. I had been using my tv in the living room to access our streaming services. In our bedroom I was doing the same but that tv is older and didnt have youtube tv so I got a Google chromecast and got sick of controlling with my phone so I moved the roku from the garage. I noticed that YouTube tv looked better on my bedroom tv than the expensive tv in the living room. So I order a roku ultra off Amazon for the living room and hooked it up yesterday both tv and roku were wired connected to the modem and I was right I'm now getting an awesome picture quality.

1276,1276,R2GF3N3MKUQFEU,Buggy HDCP Prevents use on UHD/4K TV,"Unit works for a while, then spontaneously fails the 'High Def. Content Protection (HDCP)' handshake with the TV.

It instructs you to disconnect your HDMI cables and unplug the TV and Roku, and then to re connect and try again. It also suggests that your HDMI cable 05 be 'low quality'. Roku online help just repeats the advice on the error screen... endlessly. No help at all. A common complaint of Roku tech help is that it is useless. So one is advised to avoid any models of Roku that have problematic behavior. The HDCP handshake error problem seems to be only characteristic of the Ultra 2020 model.

(not hdcp compliant), almost sent it back! Took a few hours: initial set up on ROKU showed the input through my preamp as not UHDR compliant (but it is)., asked if wanted to 'force' HDR. Of course dummy me said yes; got a purple screen on tv and no sound through preamp. Could not get a signal fromany of my other outputs or see the display on my TV!. Unhooked ROKU and still nothing from anything, no sound from other inputs or TV. Had to unplug preamp and wait untill ewerything reset somehow. Did this twice before i gave up. Plugged ROKU into TV by itslf (OLED LG) and worked fine on different input but only throughTV! Finally went throughTV menue for inputs designation and noticed the one from my preamp was HDR; changed this to 'UltraHDR DEEP COLLOR"" and ran ROKU back through preamp on same input as previously and finally got it to work! Only problem was ewerything else hooked to preamp had no sund! Had to change input back to no 'DEEP CLOR' to watch my normal Direc TV etc. So here is the deal; IF YOU DONT haveDHCP2.1 /2 on your other inputs (notUHDR) you will have problems! you can just hook it straight to your UHDR input and get all the bells and whistles OR you must change input on TV to UHDR to use ROKU through preamp even if you have UHDR input on preamp! One last thing: the AI in ROKU will change your input on the TV after using for awhile toaccept UHDR by itself and you ill have to change it back to watch regular HD, otherwise you wont get sound out from your TV or Preamp!

1283,1283,R3HFXKX02MXO5M,Great new Roku,"I bought this Roku recently to replace an older one. Mainly for higher processing power. It certainly seems to work. My only complaint is that the batteries in the remote will drain completely out within two to three days using the headphone jack. Of course, I have wireless headphones that sit on a charging cradle overnight to recharge. If I don't do that they run out within a day or two also, so I guess I can't really find fault with the Roku remote. I'm continuing to use my Stenhieheser wireless headphones and I'm sure the Roku remote batteries will last now for a 12ent amount of time. Other than that this Roku works like all the others, but I am getting far superior and quicker access due to faster processing speed within the device. I have a newish LG 70-inch s03t TV which cannot hold a candle to the processing power of this Roku.

1287,1287,R3LKYJOK1L3I2W,Know what you want before you buy!,"Love this little box. The main reason I chose this over the streaming sticks or other devices are as follows: I wanted an ethernet port. It sits by the router, but still, I wanted a hardwire connection. Before the connections gets to my router, I have a 4-port ethernet switch so my Roku and Ring Alarm are always connected, regardless of any router issues. I haven’t seen any ethernet options for the sticks. I wanted dedicated buttons. Minimalist remotes are everywhere, and while the Roku is pretty bare bones, it came with 4 dedicated buttons for streaming services and I happen to use 3 of the 4 most often. I’ve been using the apps on my s03t TV but there’s typically lag or just random wonkiness. None of that with the Roku I wanted to connect hard drives with personal media, like photos, music, etc. the USB port on my TV is so high that 8 need to stack things under my hard drives so they’re not dangling in the air. The Roku Ultra cleans all that up, while taking up less space than the cable box it’s replacing. The remote is responsive and setting it up to also control my TV is a breeze. I have heard that if your soundbar uses HDMI audio then the Roku can control it as well. Alas, my Vizio soundbar doesn’t have that. So I do still need two remotes (down from three: TV, Soundbar, Spectrum). The user interface is snappy and easily customizable. One thing I wish I had done BEFORE setting it up, is downloading the app to my phone. I HATE using the stupid arrow to type in all the log in info for every app. Had I known in advance, I would have downloaded the app and used the phone as a remote instead. There is a keyboard option and you can type in everything on your phone. Much easier than the endless arrow scrolling! Haven’t used voice recognition. Was hoping that would also work as talk-to-text for those app log ins, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that. Would be a nice feature in the future. All in all, it’s simplified the clutter by my TV and streamlined my streaming.

1292,1292,R17Q5WVKDLMFLK,Very loud controller button clicks!,Can't believe it but I am actually disappointed. Our roku 4k stick is amazing but this ultra is not as good. 2 reasons that make this a worse option in my opinion. 1. The buttons on the controller are loud to click. It wakes up my animals just to hit a button on this a couple times and with a streaming remote you'll be hearing hundreds and hundreds of loud clicks while browsing options. Phones have options to shut click sounds off so this is a really poor design choice. 2. The back button takes you back to the roku home screen 1 out of 3 times using it. This doesn't happen on the roku sticks but really annoying when you are just trying to go back one menu screen and it takes you fully all the way back to the beginning. Might send this unit back to see of this 2nd reason is caused only by a defective unit. Overall I'd suggest going with a much cheaper option as I find the improvements to be more of set backs. I seriously hate the loud button clicks. It's really that awful. I never look forward to using this and miss the 4k stick.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17Q5WVKDLMFLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,3,True,3.0,2021,2,O.S. 9.4,i had purchased the firestick previously i found the menu a bit overwhelming and not very user friendly roku much easier to use also better quality really happy with it,purchased firestick previously found menu bit overwhelming user friendly much easier use also better quality really happy,purchas firestick previous found menu bit overwhelm user friendli much easier use also better qualiti realli happi

1358,1358,RK0D1XP7OJ3LM,Roku Ultra 2020 Is a Great Upgrade Choice,"I'm glad I upgraded from the FireTV Stick. The FireTV is a great little streamer. BUT ! If your looking for something like a Ferrari instead of a Tractor then this will do it. With the quad core running this thing theirs no wait time. The menus are far superior and user interface are way beyond the others. I've had S03T stuff since the very beginning and this one has been the best for me. I haven't try any of the other new ones or more expensive but since this one worked out of the box beyond my expectations I think I'll use this for a while. They give you one of the best scree savers I've ever had. It's a live aquarium with tropical fish and coral and it all moves nicely so you get no screen burn. I need something like this because I have a 58"" plasma display. I didn't see much difference between Ethernet and WiFi as far as bandwidth goes I use fiber optic 500up and 500 down . The WiFi works great with all my sources scatted around the house. The Router, Extended and Access Point WiFi all picked up very strong. There is a ROKU 2020 model without Ethernet if you want to save money and don't wire your devices. I haven't investigated yet if you can hook up all the neat stuff like you can to the FireTV and the USB port on the ROKU Ultra is not to add room for apps, Yet. It does not have a TV tuner either so you will have to depend on your own local TV source. ROKU does come with a great TV menu that adds a lot of TV channels and is worth it just for that . Also add Airy TV app. If your cutting the cable and don't have a streaming device yet , get this one first. Spend a little more and you will be glad you did.

1372,1372,R2HYAHFESRJ4U,Works great for our needs,"I researched Roku vs AppleTV. Although I would have liked the AppleTV the issue with their slippery remote was a concern. My husband is not techy and we’ve used Roku for years so I felt to stick to what we’re used to. Based on the size of my house, where my router is located and how we use our streaming (no gaming), I 12ided on the Roku Ultra. We’re completely happy with our choice; both for price and functionality. The service is updated with the listening button on the remote. The 50% more boost on the wifi took care of our lag problem with streaming on our old Roku. My husband has no learning curve for the remote. Our picture is clear on our s03t tv. We love it!!! One note: Roku does not accept certain special characters on the router. So if Roku cannot connect to your router and all other steps fail, use another device hotspot (that does not use the wifi) to connect Roku and activate it. Then change your router’s password and try removing all special chars on your router’s password first to isolate. After I tried this with the help of Roku agents, everything worked perfectly. I found it was only one or two special characters in my router’s password that was preventing Roku to connect.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HYAHFESRJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,1,O.S. 9.4,easy to set up and no issues with the hardline option instead of using the wi fi the remote does need some work the volume and mute on the side does make it annoying every time you pick it up you hit one of the buttons,easy set issues hardline option instead using wi fi remote need work volume mute side make annoying every time pick hit one buttons,easi set issu hardlin option instead use wi fi remot need work volum mute side make annoy everi time pick hit one button

1375,1375,R22DSE9YMUM5NY,"It's okay, with several caveats","I bought this device both to consolidate my streaming subscriptions and for the Dolby audio and video. GOOD: Using the Roku Ultra as a hub is more convenient than switching between apps on s03t TV, PS4, laptop, etc, plus flipping various settings on my A/V receiver to accommodate. When it's working perfectly, the video quality is great and the DD+ sound is a step up from the standard 5.1 I was getting using an optical cable connection between TV and A/V receiver. However, the Roku hardware/firmware/whatever does leave several things to be desired. NOT SO GOOD: As others have noted, I will not infrequently get kicked out of an app mid-stream and shunted to the Roku home page. This normally doesn't happen more than once per night per app, but it does happen at least once per viewing session. I am usually able to resume the video somewhat close to where I was booted. I have restarted the device several times since first install; it does not seem to address this issue. Not as not infrequently, the Roku will freeze entirely, during which time the buttons on the remote do nothing for up to a minute. This generally stops on its own; I haven't yet had to unplug the power cord. Regarding the streaming itself: I have historically believed (and been proven right) that a wired connection is the preferable way of hooking up any sort of streaming device. Initially, that's how I connected the Roku, and I found that the rule does not seem to hold true here. Occasionally, especially during 4k movies, I would notice intrusive video artifacts briefly appearing on screen, pixelated blocks of semi-transparent green and red. Eventually, I came to the conclusion this was a by-product of the device switching between resolutions. My bandwidth is 100mbps, which should be enough for stable 4k streaming, and my laptop (in the same general location as the Roku) tests at full speed using either wired ethernet or 5ghz wireless. For whatever reason, connection tests run on the Roku hit around 55-65mbps for wired and just slightly lower for 5ghz wireless. Despite the ostensibly slower results, after connecting the Roku using wireless, I have noticed the visual artifacts less frequently and intrusively, although they do still appear once in a while. I have also since found forums with users stating their similar experiences: the Roku Ultra's wireless connection overall seems more stable than its wired connection. OVERALL: By this point in their release cycle, I'd have thought Roku would have ironed out very noticeable user experience issues, especially where basic features and performance are involved. This does not seem to be the case. However, the Roku Ultra 2020 was at a discounted price when I bought it, plus I had a gift card and credit. For the price I paid, the convenience of consolidated streaming plus for-the-most-part high quality video and sound outweigh the performance glitches. I do not think the device is worthy of its standard $80+ price tag. *Note I do not use the voice recognition, Bluetooth, or private listening features, so while they are of no value to me, I'm sure the price tag takes them into account.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22DSE9YMUM5NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,3,True,4.0,2021,1,O.S. 9.4,i love this roku this was my first time getting a streaming device and i think i hit the nail on the head with this one the only thing i didn t like was that the control was so small and with no grip but i fix that by ordering the silicone grip cover that supposed to glow in the dark even though mine doesn t glow in the dark but it makes it easy to find control and hold all together i love it,love first time getting streaming device think hit nail head one thing like control small grip fix ordering silicone grip cover supposed glow dark even though mine glow dark makes easy find control hold together love,love first time get stream devic think hit nail head one thing like control small grip fix order silicon grip cover suppos glow dark even though mine glow dark make easi find control hold togeth love

The reception for this ROKU Ultra is much better, and we have had no lagging, or ""freezes"" since installing it. It loads our apps such as Netflix, Prime, and Xfinity Stream much faster. As a bonus, we were able to ditch our oversized and outdated TV remote for our Samsung TV, as it instantly recognized the model and we can power and volume up/down on our TV from the single ROKU remote. Haven't used the voice feature much or headphone interface at all, but can only assume they will work well. Overall, a good upgrade...anyone wanna buy a ROKU Express? ha ha.

1383,1383,R16P1JTGA9ZRZ8,Company so far unwilling to fix a glaring problem,"I would normally give this product a good review as I generally like it. However, it has one glaring problem which is magnified by the company's so far reluctance to fix it. When using the remote control, after using it for not long, a message starts to flash several times a minute that states that the batteries are low and needs to be changed. This flashes for several seconds in the upper roght-hand side of the screen, and then repeats after about 15 seconds. There is no way to stop it or change it in any way. It is VERY annoying, and it is well documented in their web site that customers have been asking for a fix to this for quite a while. So far, the company refuses to do anything about it. It is made worse by the fact that the batteries are in fact NOT low and work quite effectively for several more days before they finally do need to be changed. If the company would just allow end users to turn OFF the most annoying message, or even change the frequency of the message to perhaps once every five minutes or so, then I would change my rating. So far, they have not shown any willingness to do a software upgrade to their product to fix this. I invented my own work around by purchasing rechargeable batteries, and simply switch them out and recharge them when the message appears which is all too often. At least this way I am not going through a great deal of batteries unnecessarily, which is both costly, frustrating, and not good for the

1428,1428,R2OKYRWCL4Y00M,Great replacement for Amazon stick and satellite service with local channels,"I like that this box can run Amazon Prime video over hard-wired Ethernet. Amazon's own devices are all WiFi. This fixed issues we were having with our Amazon stick. (Glitching sound, and occasionally crashing) We replaced our satellite service and local channels (Dallas) with YouTube TV over this device. There are no channel up/down buttons and skip ahead/back require an extra button press to resume playback (why does it pause?) but otherwise it's good. I like having local TV and basic cable-type channels with pause/record capability in the same app. I couldn't find an easy way to integrate over-the-air TV DVR with streaming channels on any device. At best they would be on different apps. My biggest gripe is that the Roku remote won't control my A/V amplifier volume. (Or any, apparently.)

1433,1433,R2G6WOK55DT48I,Nothing but problems,"Roku has a known problem with its New 'Ultra' and the forums are pretty angry over it. Approx 30% of the time watching any station, you will lose the ability to actually pause the show you are watching. Of course the only way you realize this is trying to pause, screen goes blank, sound & show continue, and you have to exit out of what you are watching entirely, and go back in (if you are lucky it'll put you back to where you TRIED to pause, otherwise you get to start again and FF to the spot). My response from Roku all of us has been 'If you give us all the infomration, serial number, time of day, show/channel, etc......) we'll send it to our tech guys and get you a response in some vague distant timeline. and is definitely NOT what you would expect from their latest nor anything named ' Ultra ' Edit: Also if you add a flash drive the device (none of my Rokus) will read it on start up, the only resolution I've found it to start Roku, unplug the drive and replug.

The 4800 handles the 12oding, converting DD+ 5.1 to DD for those who have older AVR's. This is a nice feature (my older Roku 4400x did not support the DD+ to DD 12oding). Benefits to this model (2020 - Roku 4800): * 4K HDR Support * DD+ to DD 5.1 Surround 12oding A great Roku product.

I tried different hdmi cords and still no fix. My firestick and apple TV runs at 1080p just fine on my TV and the issue only happens with my new roku. Even tried the all the recommendations like resets, updates, and turning off auto hz detection. Worst of all amazon can't even replace mine. They cant even refund the full value to include the promo vouchers I used to buy this. Upset and stuck paying for a faulty product. Canceling my prime membership. Very upsetting.

The volume and mute buttons are on the right side of the remote, where your thumb naturally falls when you're holding the remote, not too bright, but after muting the audio once I merely shifted the way I hold it....no problem after that.

1453,1453,R37Z818G9ILROQ,Roku is great.,"So I started out with the original Chromecast for when streaming from devices first came out. Then I got a firestick, which I now have on a kitchen tv. I also have an Xbox one I use for streaming. So I wanted to try out Roku. I will say that I'm impressed and very satisfied. First, the layout of the user interface is easier to use than the Firestick. The menus are clear and pretty intuitive. Second, the remote of the Roku is better in my opinion. The firestick round directional pad looks nice, but it lacks the feel and responsiveness that the Roku gives you. Getting the version with the power and volume buttons is a must in my opinion. Also a plus is that on some versions, you can plug headphones into the remote to engage private listening, for when you want to watch, but not disturb others around you. Third, the voice search on the Roku is just as responsive as the Firestick, but the results are displayed better in the Roku. If I search for Karate Kid, Roku will list all the versions available across all my streaming services and list them in order from free to pay to watch(showing how much to rent on each platform). this is something that Firestick does not do.

1457,1457,R25KKMHSY65Y6,Great upgrade over my old Fire TV,"Bought this as a replacement / upgrade for an older Fire TV box. Roku's user interface and speed has definitely improved. At the time the Fire TV was rated the best. Comparing new to old, the Roku is faster, easier to use, easy to setup, and the remote very quickly linked with the TV to control it as well. I happen to use a Harmony Hub and a phone app instead, but it was nice to see that the remote worked. As for Harmony Hub integration, it was quick and easy and works like a dream.

1463,1463,R2NKO75J6W8VLK,Roku is great but dont buy from amazon unless you want to get ripped off,"I was using the Roku Express ($25) on my 4k TV for a while. I still would recommend the express for non UHD TV owners for their first Roku experience. I 12ided to finally shell out the money for the 2020 Ultra and so far I'm satisfied. The picture is much sharper, even for cartoons and non uhd content. I also like the ethernet port in the back. Now I don't have to worry about buffering! I moved my old Roku (2019 Roku Express) into the guest room. If you don't have an UHD TV then I think the Roku express would get the job done but if you have a 4k TV then its definitely worth upgrading to the 2020 Ultra. I would like to add is that the 2020 Ultra does not seem to overheat like the reviewers of the 2019 Ultra have mentioned. It gets a little warm but nothing more than a desktop computer doing normal tasks. Finally, don't be foolish and google search ""Roku Setup"" if you are technologically illiterate. Many times it can link to a fraudulent website that charges you money for a fake activation. Either read the instruction manual or pay a friend/neighbor/grand-child to set it up. Takes less than 15 minutes! You can also go to my.roku.com/signup/nocc (OFFICIAL WEBSITE) to avoid needing to enter debit/credit card info.

1484,1484,RT9YU2XBN8DU1,Better than the roku stick.,"I got this to replace my roku stick. We are switching from satellite tv to streaming and the roku stick was a little slow. I also wanted a remote that could control the power and volume of the tv and the stick remote did not do that. So far this is better.. It is noticeably faster than the roku stick and the remote does control the TV. I was surprised by the headphone jack on the remote.. what a great idea! Getting older and having trouble hearing the headphone jack is a very welcome addition.. However, it would be nice to have a way to use the headphones and not mute the sound from the TV so other could watch at the same time. I have tried the programmable buttons with limited success. You really can only program them by issuing a voice command and so far I have not worked out a way to use the voice command do do things like open a certain app and tune to a specific channel. It would also be nice to be able to reprogram the four dedicated buttons that show hulu, netflix, disney+ and roku channels.

has worked exceptionally well by the way at any rate i m grateful to finally get a full refund on this roku device and grateful also that i swapped it out for the fire cube which is ready to handle k whenever i upgrade my tv update returned the roku ultra to the ups store per amazon instructions and received my refund unfortunately i was charged a restocking fee which amounted to about of my purchase price when i contacted customer service i was told it was automatically applied because i returned the item on but when i set up the return the authorization said to send by mon and it was returned on that date very disappointed in this update finally had enough and put this back in the box for return when i reinstalled my old roku i was shocked to see how much faster it navigated within apps compared to the balky ultra so the ultra has far more problems than i had originally discerned as others have pointed out you can reboot the unit to get around most problems but it makes no sense to do so especially when the roku performs so well reading through the other reviews it appears that roku has had a significant diminution in product quality in the last couple of years with a commensurate line in customer support when the roku gives up the ghost or i upgrade to a k set i likely will switch to apple or fire bought this to replace my roku which has always performed flawlessly the ultra synced perfectly added all of my apps was easy to use nice picture quality and sound problem it does not always work specifically it will freeze when you pause content black screen but content is still playing they you have to exit to the main roku screen to regain control then go back to the app and start all over then discover that your content is five minutes past where you left off so when you try to rewind it blacks out again does it on several different channels so not a channel issue also occasionally will freeze up and you can t even use the home button to go to the roku main screen takes about a minute or two for it finally to unfreeze so you can go back to roku home i use the replay function and pause function a lot so this is a definite deal breaker

After using Roku for a while, I have noticed that because the UI is so simple I spend less time trying to find something to watch. There are very minimal distractions and for that reason you go directly to what you want to watch. There are adds/recommended movies and shows but they don’t feel intrusive or distracting. It has many “free (with Adds) content that I did not have in AppleTV. The biggest win for me was the “Private Listening”. It works perfectly. Not only from the remote but you can also listen to your movies through the app with your phone and there is no lag. I love that they still have the option to use wired headphones. Even though everything is going wireless, I work with a wireless headphones all day and like to disconnect when watching TV privately. The Roku app works unbelievably good.

I must use them because my home, with cable internet, has no antenna reception of any channels over the air. I now have a Roku for each TV. This Roku works as well as the others. The latest Ultra version has bluetooth connectivity, which is handy for the headphones/earbuds. The volume control is a problem--the remote has the mute button EXACTLY where you would have your thumb (if right-handed). So, when you pick up the remote, you mute the TV almost every time. It's amazing that Roku would continue this terrible ergonomic design flaw, when the rest works so excellent. The wireless aspect is great, as you don't need to point directly at the Roku in order to change channels. Thus, this is great for running your TV channels while on an exercise machine. And infrared also works--you need it for the volume control of your TV. A bonus: This Ultra remote sends the wireless signals, but Infrared is also sent out as well, so you can carry it into another room and (usually) control an Ultra Premiere as well (Premiere is only infrared).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KOWOSLGW10I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,1,O.S. 9.4,choice of channels apps great connectivity options fast performance outstanding video,choice channels apps great connectivity options fast performance outstanding video,choic channel app great connect option fast perform outstand video

1517,1517,R8WSFWZ39DRB5,WiFi Claims from Roku are Bogus,"I've been a Roku customer for over 10 years. I bought the very first model. I had, until Christmas, a Roku 2 and a Roku Express in use. At my request my wife bought me the Roku Ultra for Christmas. I have gigabit fiber coming into my house with a terrific wifi route, so I wanted to exploit that. I have 2 networks, a 2.4 GHz for phones and other devices, and a ultra fast 5GHz network for laptops and iPads. My 2 Rokus can only use the 2.4 GHz network. When I went to add the Ultra to the 5 GHz network, it couldn't find it. I entered the SSID manually and still no joy. I added it to the 2.4 GHz network as a stop gap. I did some reading on the Ultra and 5 GHz and found a post from someone having the same problem. The solution from Roku was to set the 'Bandwidth' setting for the network down to 20 (it was 80). The explanation for that setting on the router says to not change it, the higher the bandwidth the faster the speed. Anyway I did change the bandwidth to 20, and the Roku then saw the 5GHz network. The problem was that the speeds to ALL the other devices on that network were reduced by a factor of 4 (nothing was streaming to the Roku when I checked the speeds). I couldn't take the speed hit for my laptop or my wife's iPad, so I had to reset the bandwidth back to the default value. The Roku then couldn't find that network. If I didn't need my old Roku for a third TV, I would have returned it.

When this set receives an HDR or Dolby Vision signal it displays it in the upper right corner at the start of the program. I've confirmed this many times with the onboard apps. Unfortunately ... LGs App Store is missing many key apps. We had a 2019 Ultra connected for those extra apps and had been switching back and forth between the Ultra (for missing apps) and onboard (for Dolby Vision content). 12ided to upgrade to the 2020 model so that we could stay with just the Roku for everything. Unfortunately ... the purpose for which it was purchased ... the output of Dolby Vision ... does not occur, according to the LG. To make matters worse, will not even output HDR. No indication of either. Both are fed thru a 2020 03antz receiver with these capabilities a 4K, full resolution HDMI Arc input. Nada ... and the picture looks obviously less than that same program from the onboard app. Roku's own community forum shows numerous others complaining of the the same issue ... many of whom have complained to Roku. Roku appears to have done nothing about it other than providing brief lip service before ghosting the customer.

1540,1540,R1F51JL902U9UU,Thanks but No Thanks,"The good news: By default Dolby Vision is enabled on this unit. The bad news: If the source is not Dolby Vision it attempts to simulate in such a poorly executed way that you might be forgiven for thinking you got a defective unit. Despite the use of the ARC input and the ""enhanced"" input configuration, the default display characteristic is unusable. Most of the content I watch is not encoded for DV, but if I did have content encoded for DV I would presumably have to remember to go into the ROKU Ultra settings menu and re-enable the DV-capable default. (It is unclear if DV would automatically activate even if I set the TV to use 4K/HDR display mode.) A DV-equipped ROKU seemed like a nice idea but the look of the ""upsampling"" was akin to staring at the sun — blindingly bright whites, poor contrast (washed out), the look of standard definition resolution and considerable blooming and chromatic artifacts thrown in for good measure. No thanks! 1/2/2021 UPDATE: My experience with this product occurred in con06ction with a SONY XBR900F. Perhaps it is something about my TV, but with this ROKU Ultra 2020 connected, it appears to try to ""upsample"" non-DV content to DV (""Dolby Vision"" appears even when non-DV content is playing). The result is a garish, washed-out looking mess. Reverting to HDR mode in the settings restored the blown out color/contrast but the definition (image quality) appeared to be degraded over my ROKU Stick+ (2019). I also heard a small popping sound out of my speakers when switching between channels on the Home screen. I thought I purchased a dud so I bought a ROKU LT (non-DV version) but now I can't even get past activation (no activation email ever shows up and a search of my In Box and SPAM folders reveals nothing). After struggling for a week, I concluded the ROKU LT was a dud, so I bought another ROKU Ultra (this model) — except I can't activate this one either (no email containing an activation link arrives despite repeated tries, factory resets, etc.). Word to the wise: ROKU forums are filled with reports of existing users being unable to add new devices. There's only one workaround — open another account (alternate email address, add payment method, re-do your channel lineup and preferences). ROKU refuses to explain why new device users are being subjected to what seems like an activation lockout. I submitted a Customer Question here on Amazon to see if others were having problems activating their new ROKUs — but Amazon hasn't posted my question, hence I am updating my review as an FYI. Long story short, I have been struggling to get something to work since before Christmas — and now I am up against the deadline to return my more recent ROKU purchases because I'm running out of time to wait on ROKU support to provide, well, ""support"". Belatedly, ROKU customer service sent a response to a support chat consisting of a transcript and a statement to the effect that if they don't hear from me, they will assume my issue is resolved. (In fact, this was the first time they had sent anything support related to my email despite sending messages to their forum moderator asking for support to reach out to me.) I have been using ROKU for almost 10 years but with every purchase since 2018, I find it necessary to return devices because of product quality problems (defects). If ROKU support can't provide any help tying my newly-purchased devices to my account, I 05 have no choice but to jump ship for Fire Stick or Apple TV.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F51JL902U9UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,2,False,,2020,12,O.S. 9.4,the volume level on this roku box is bad i can put the volume level at and the voice level sounds like it is on there should be an update for this problem,volume level box bad put volume level voice level sounds like update problem,volum level box bad put volum level voic level sound like updat problem
1541,1541,R30VR65GLE1T5,Ultra is amazing,"Having previously owned several Roku units (most recently a Roku 3), it was a no-brainer for me to go with the Roku Ultra when it came time to replace my existing box. This model does not disappoint. Very easy and intuitive setup process; it literally took me 10 minutes including signing into my various streaming accounts. The ""premium HDMI cable"" that's included feels a little on the cheap side, but I'm not using it anyway (already have AmazonBasics cable) and expensive HDMI cables are largely a gimmick. The remote feels significantly more substantial in the hand than previous examples did. Once in your paw, it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. Haven't tried the voice search feature, but I'm guessing it works fine and will be used little anyway. Comparing it to the Roku 3...well, there is no comparison. Right out of the gate this unit is noticeably faster. Meaning faster to access streaming apps, faster to get the titles to come up...faster, faster, faster. I haven't watched a ton on it yet, but I'd swear the audio and video quality of what I have seems better. 05be that's wishful thinking, but I'm happy for now.

1547,1547,ROWWD6A65I7O8,Doesn't hold up to the 2017 model,"I've had a 2017 model that I've used every day for the last 3 years and figured I'd buy a new one because of the upgraded sound and network connectivity. When I opened the box I already knew what was going on. Compared to the 2017, this model feels absolutely cheap like a toy. The ""improved wireless network"" is exactly the same Mbps as the 2017 except the ""Wired"" ethernet connection speed is about 20Mbps less than the 2017 (??!). I hope I just got a defective one but all-around a much cheaper, cut-corners crap-o item that is insulting to long-time Roku loyalists. Pros: Faster channel loading Improved audio settings for compatible soundbars Cons: Feels much cheaper Network is tested to be worse than 2017 model (especially wired ethernet, which is mind-boggling) Energy and bandwidth settings only work sometimes, not every time. Conclusion: Roku has to step the next one up with quality parts and work on these flaws. The 2017 model was the best one I've used and I would rather use its limited audio co12s than a buggy, cheap-feeling player.

1553,1553,R2OWASZ72WH4QT,Significant improvement over the Roku Premier,"I use my Roku Ultra all the time. It's connected to an LG s03t TV, but the Roku has infinitely more channels and is much easier to use. I really only got a S03t TV because you can't buy a nice TV that isn't s03t. The new remote doesn't require line-of-sight to work, which is great when you have large dogs that like to get between you and the TV. It supports the latest technologies (HDR 10, Dolby Atmos, etc.) and even though I don't have other equipment yet that supports all of these, I know I'll be ready when I do upgrade my other equipment. And now that HBO Max and Peacock are (finally!) available, it has pretty much every streaming channel available. The little things like themes and screen savers have also improved, which I enjoy. It boots up faster than the Roku Premier that I replaced with it, has better wireless connectivity (faster and more reliable), and has a clearer picture than the Premier (especially on UHD and 4K). I also like the programmable channel buttons and the voice controls on the remote. The pri03y disappointment is the fact that it only supports 2.4 GHz bandwidth (5 GHz isn't supported), which doesn't seem to impact performance, but it seems like it should support the faster bandwidth. Also, while I love having volume controls on the Roku remote (and they do work with the TV), their placement on the side of the remote (along with moving the mute button there as well) means I often accidentally mute my TV or change the volume because I forget they are there. The remote is bigger and heavier than the old one, but to me that is an advantage as it feels more substantial and less fragile. And it's still small, so it's not a big deal. One feature that I would like more if it worked better is the ability to use voice control inside some apps. You can use the remote control's voice capabilities inside some apps to do things like type in login information or searches, etc. It isn't available in all apps, and it doesn't always give the results you expect, but I'm sure it will improve with updates.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OWASZ72WH4QT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,2.0,2020,12,O.S. 9.4,this doesnt read mac formatted hard drive like the previous versions not gonna reformat my tb media drive for one device guess ill just keep my roku ultra ruined a great thing,doesnt read mac formatted hard drive like previous versions gonna reformat tb media drive one device guess ill keep ultra ruined great thing,doesnt read mac format hard drive like previou version gonna reformat tb media drive one devic guess ill keep ultra ruin great thing

trying to stick to bullet points and what felt like a script for support they even suggested i try turning the resolution settings down to see if that fixed it why in the world would you buy a roku ultra at this premium price just to stick to settings the cheaper units could have handled this was highly disappointing considering i ve owned essentially every tier of roku product previously including roku express premiere and ultras of varying generations and when one finally failed this was how i was treated to amazon s credit returning the unit was simple and i was issued a refund

1555,1555,RTCM9IL1WN0T3,"Good-ish device, bad remote.",The great thing about this if upgrading from an older Roku like I was is the simple performance. When researching never ones I was mostly concerned with Processor and Memory of the device because I was sick of apps running like garbage. Well it worked. This thing is buttery smooth at present. The negatives? Being the newest device with the newest processor it does have some bugs but I suspect Roku is diligently working them. They also aren’t horrible. The biggest problem is this remote. I recommend NOT linking it to your TV so that the mute button doesn’t work. I hit this thing constantly when handling the remote.

With Apple TV you able to customize the home screen, I only have the apps I use most on the home screen and I put all the stuff I don't use in a separate folder such as settings app, arcade app, music app and app store. I had a problem with the subtitles coming on by accident all the time and it was a pain to turn off all the time. I did not like the feel of the Roku remote it feels to clunky, seems very outdated, and the Apple TV remote is pretty bad too.

Within days of installing this new device the picture on our tv went from normal to 1/4 size in the bottom left corner. This happened regardless of what channel we were streaming - YouTubeTV, TUBI, Netflix, Prime etc. Uninstalled and reinstalled it (and all of our apps). Worked only for that day then the next day it went back to switching the screen to the bottom left 1/4th corner. Ordered a second one as a replacement. Same thing happened the day after it was installed and every day since. Looked it up and many, many users of this device also have this issue. The fix is to unplug the power cord EVERY DAY when it happens, and it will happen at least once a day. This is unacceptable. Roku must know the Ultra device is Inherently defective, but is still selling them. I contacted Amazon and was switched to four people, none of which had an answer.

The audio would also go out and would sometimes come back a second or two after the video did. This was constant. From the moment the device turned on. I couldn't even set up the device properly because the screen kept flickering on and off while I'm attempting to navigate menus and type in usernames and passwords to my streaming services. I thought it would stop once I tried playing a video, it did not. I only got every few words of an episode of Supernatural. The device is completely and utterly unusable in this state.

1598,1598,R25JPVBMGGWLKB,"Cannot Control Soundbar, YouTube is buggy, feels old (this is the 2020 edition!?)","Unfortunately the remote will not control a soundbar using the IR blaster on the remote. It will only use the IR to send a signal to the TV to change the volume and then the TV will use HDMI-CEC to change the volume on the soundbar. If your soundbar does not use HDMI-CEC or you use your sound device without the use of HDMI you are out of luck and will have to use two different remotes. There is no work around or functionality to use the IR on the remote to control the sound device directly, which is ridiculous considering the size of the remote and the amount of space on the remote dedicated to the IR blaster. It will not even turn on the sound bar using IR, which if it did even that simple task I might have considered keeping this instead of returning it. I only had the device for 3 weeks and the batteries that came brand new in the box went from 100% to 65%. YouTube is buggy. Ads will always play but will many times start with a very loud ""POP!"" for no reason that is several times louder than the volume of everything else. When videos are started and when coming back to video after an ad many times the audio will cut out entirely for a few seconds, which then requires you to rewind to 10+ seconds before the ad so it actually loads the audio in time. The YouTube app will also display the gray animated circle for buffering over the video for a few seconds when you start a video and when you fast forward or rewind in a video, and this is every time. The interface overall of the device just feels old and way out dated. Discoverability is not very easy to use and is confusing (why can I not see movies and only TV shows?). I returned this device and replaced it with a Chromecast with Google TV. None of the above issues exist with the Chromecast. The Chromecast will control the volume of my soundbar using IR and I just have the soundbar turn on when it detects signal from the TV and it turns off automatically after 25 minutes of no signal. The Chromecast also works much more easily and smoothly with Google Assistant. Google assistant functionality on the Roku Ultra was limited to ""turn on, turn off, launch app"".",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25JPVBMGGWLKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,2,True,,2020,12,O.S. 9.4,this unit replaced a much older roku connected to a tv that doesn t have a cable box between the roku and a good in room leaf antenna there s plenty to watch on that tv this new roku is noticeably better than the year old unit it replaced i never get any buffering type messages on it the remote is a huge improvement over the old one specifically because it s voice search enabled i m very happy with this upgrade and have had no problems with it,unit replaced much older connected cable box good room leaf antenna plenty watch new noticeably better year old unit replaced never get buffering type messages remote huge improvement old one specifically voice search enabled happy upgrade problems,unit replac much older connect cabl box good room leaf antenna plenti watch new notic better year old unit replac never get buffer type messag remot huge improv old one specif voic search enabl happi upgrad problem

I’ll stop watching on S01E03 of a series, start up the next day and the app indicates I watched to S02E05! (No, I’m not sleep-watching and no, nobody else has access to my account. This is 100% the Roku Ultra’s fault.) - No longer has ability to turn TV off! Streaming Stick+ supports this! Unless you use the TV’s HDMI-CEC port, in which case yes it turns off your stuff but then fails to turn them all back on (I have to manually turn on my sound bar every time). - Buggy remote.

For the tech types, it's not open like android based devices, so it's not likely that you can sideload apps or do anything not sanctioned by Roku. Honestly, the constant updating and bugginess of the more open source devices just wasn't worth the little bit of extra content you could find. You can keep those if you want to use them, but for daily watching, this thing is a great option. It's way faster than our older Samsung s03t tv and reasonably faster than our Firestick. It's kind of idiot proof, so you can't do much to it that hitting the home button won't fix:-).

1660,1660,R1DYLQ05SDX7H7,A super upgrade,"This is probably our fifth Roku. We have been a Roku family for years, from one of the first generations. We have tried other streaming devices, but always come back to Roku because we prefer it’s UI—simple and easy to use. All our televisions rely on Roku in some iteration. Back in the days when WiFi could be a bit iffy, we preferred a streaming device that didn’t rely on it for our pri03y television. That isn’t such a big deal now (all our other televisions use WiFi-dependent Rokus), but it’s still a feature I appreciate for this particular television. This is an upgrade of our oldest Roku (itself an earlier upgrade)—and we only got it because it was struggling just a bit with buffering due to being older tech. This one has been a joy—rock solid, fast, and simply simple to use. We haven’t yet tried all its features—we don’t talk to our devices much, so we haven’t even tried voice recognition, and we haven’t yet tried AirPlay (but this is an awesome feature!) or Bluetooth (also nice for private listening), but we love being able to rely on just one remote for the basics instead of having to juggle two.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DYLQ05SDX7H7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2020,12,O.S. 9.4,had unit for months and now unit will recognize my wireless network but is unable to connect to the internet rendering unit useless for internet streaming additionally from beginning of ownership roku unit would not recognize tb usb hard drives whereas my older roku ultra would now using my older travel roku ultra and it works fine except no dolby vision,unit months unit recognize wireless network unable connect internet rendering unit useless internet streaming additionally beginning ownership unit would recognize tb usb hard drives whereas older ultra would using older travel ultra works fine except dolby vision,unit month unit recogn wireless network unabl connect internet render unit useless internet stream addit begin ownership unit would recogn tb usb hard drive wherea older ultra would use older travel ultra work fine except dolbi vision
1661,1661,R2AT7LZN0W21D2,"Roku Ultra the ""latest"" but not the ""greatest"" (with updates)","UPDATE 13 08 21: Received an unsolicited email from Amazon that informed me they had provided the ""incorrect amount"" on my Roku refund, and they were refunding me the additional $14 they earlier had docked me. Perhaps the email I had sent complaining about this matter finally was read by someone in their customer service department. Or perhaps they finally noticed that I replaced this balky Roku with a Fire Cube (which has worked exceptionally well, by the way). At any rate, I'm grateful to finally get a full refund on this Roku device. And grateful also that I swapped it out for the Fire Cube, which is ready to handle 4K whenever I upgrade my TV. UPDATE 1 02 21: Returned the Roku Ultra to the UPS Store, per Amazon instructions, and received my refund. Unfortunately, I was charged a $14 ""restocking"" fee, which amounted to about 20% of my purchase price. When I contacted customer service, I was told it was automatically applied because I returned the item on 02. 1. But when I set up the return, the authorization said to ""Send by: Mon, 02 1"" and it was returned on that date. Very disappointed in this. UPDATE 15 01 21: Finally had enough and put this back in the box for return. When I reinstalled my old Roku 3, I was shocked to see how much faster it navigated within apps compared to the balky Ultra. So the Ultra has far more problems than I had originally discerned. As others have pointed out, you can reboot the unit to get around most problems, but it makes no sense to do so ... especially when the Roku 3 performs so well. Reading through the other reviews, it appears that Roku has had a significant diminution in product quality in the last couple of years, with a commensurate 12line in customer support. When the Roku 3 gives up the ghost (or I upgrade to a 4K set), I likely will switch to Apple or Fire. Bought this to replace my Roku 3, which has always performed flawlessly. The Ultra synced perfectly, added all of my apps, was easy to use, nice picture quality and sound. Problem? It does not always work. Specifically, it will freeze when you pause content (black screen, but content is still playing). They you have to exit to the main Roku screen to regain control, then go back to the app and start all over (then discover that your content is five minutes past where you left off, so when you try to rewind, it blacks out again). Does it on several different channels, so not a channel issue. Also occasionally will freeze up, and you can't even use the ""home"" button to go to the Roku main screen. Takes about a minute or two for it finally to unfreeze so you can go back to Roku home. I use the ""replay"" function and ""pause"" function a lot, so this is a definite deal-breaker. I bought this for the Dolby Atmos support, the Bluetooth support, and the higher memory (faster operation). But it does not work consistently, so it is worthless. Probably going back to Amazon after Xmas, then I'll go back to the Roku 3 (unless I 12ide to try Apple or Amazon streamer).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AT7LZN0W21D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,1,True,46.0,2020,12,O.S. 9.4,bought this to replace an older roku that was having audio issues it is noticably faster to load apps with much smoother animations,bought replace older audio issues noticably faster load apps much smoother animations,bought replac older audio issu notic faster load app much smoother anim

Most of these choices required registration and monthly payments and again they didn't seem to have very good content. The programs that are add supported the add are far too frequent and the movies segments are far too short. After five minutes of watching there would be a stack of six commercials. That's worse than regular TV . My TV did not have ROKU in it so the LIVETV connection in this unit was not supported. My reception of the local TV was not improved so it is still unwatchable. It is not a complete waste, there are a number of free services included and some of them deliver quality programming.

A great benefit if you are a Spectrum cable viewer was you could avoid paying a cable box fee on a 2d tv by installing the Spectrum TV channel and providing you were using Spectrum to connect, you could watch any Spectrum channel on a roku.

1693,1693,RXD1DVCSEE9FH,Runs through batteries in days,"I like the Roku Ultra... somewhat. I do like that I can watch TV when my husband is asleep and he's not bothered by the noise. I did think that if I disconnected the wire from the remote that the sound would come out from the TV, but it doesn't, it will ONLY come through he headset. I watch TV a lot, but since the sound will only come through the headset I'm using it all the time the TV is on (whether I'm watching something or listening to something) so the battery life is severely limited. That's disappointing and now I'll have to buy rechargeable batteries because I need new ones about every two weeks. Since I don't need to use the headset during the day, it would be nice if I could just unplug the ear piece and listen to the sound directly from the TV and save on batteries. Otherwise, sound is good. Sometimes it fast forwards in a choppy way that looks weird but it catches up with the sound matching the video. Thanks Update: My remote suddenly fixed itself when the power blinked in and out during a storm. Suddenly the sound would come from the TV when the ear buds were disconnected. How about that! I also solved the battery problem by buying rechargeable batteries so I had no complaints… then… ear buds… Now the problem is that sound only comes out of one side of the ear buds.

It had a great picture quality but shortly after using it the picture started flashing in and out and doing other weird things. To determine if I received a bad unit or if it was my T.V, I hooked it up to my 4K TV and the it worked great. So the Roku unit is not bad and it was not my Sony TV.

So I ended up getting my self a Roku Ultra this year. This thing is awesome! The wifey likes that her iphone interacts with it really well. So easy to stream Netflix and Disney+ on this thing. Nothing but love for Roku. All their devices are great. But this Roku Ultra is awesome. Only complication I've seen that is in no way a deal breaker is.......for some reason on my tv it seems to set stuff so the far left edge of menus is ever so slightly cut off. I'm sure there's a way to properly adjust it, I did the auto setting option. I just haven't messed with it enough to adjust that small issue. But it's not a big problem or anything.

ordered my ultra directly from roku as amazon was back ordered it arrived on oct th one day after the release date i am using it to replace my ultra model i also have a second k tv with a roku streaming stick as well as a sharp roku tv i recently tried and returned the fire tv cube so besides reviewing the ultra i will be making comparisons the ultra is advertised as being percent faster than previous versions if it is i can barely notice not worth an upgrade if speed is your only motivation and you already have a or ultra what it does bring to the party is support for dolby atmos and dolby vision i have a k tv and audio system that support both so the upgrade was worth it for me i have found that dolby vision offered on many netflix originals is superior to standard hdr if you re not as fussy as i am about getting maximum picture quality getting dolby vision might not matter to you the fire tv cube does support both atmos and dolby vision so that is an alternative of course personally i prefer the menu system on roku i found the fire tv menu to be cluttered with ads and was always navigating around its prime video centric bias i love prime video but i didn t like being forced to always look at the prime video options first roku is a neutral displayer of viewing options another problem i had with the fire tv cube was keeping the audio in sync with the picture at least twice a day i had to unplug the cube to get the audio resynced that trick always worked but it was a nuisance i did initially have a problem with audio sync on the ultra but i was able to correct it in settings the ultra defaults to audio with auto detect i changed this audio setting to auto passthrough and that solved the problem the biggest improvement in the ultra is the remote it features a sound control rocker with a mute button it has voice search it has four quick access apps hulu sling disney and netflix in addition it has two programmable buttons which i used for quick access to prime video and youtube the remote is capable of controlling both your tv and audio receiver if both your tv and audio receiver have hdmi cec capabilities which are turned on most newer devices have hdmi cec but be sure yours do if you expect the roku remote to control your system compared to the roku streaming stick which supports k and hdr the ultra has a wired lan connection option in addition to a fast wifi with better range than previous roku devices wired is always better if you have the capability i also find that while the ultra gets pretty warm the streaming stick gets downright hot twice the streaming stick has displayed an overheat warning that makes me nervous finally the roku devices like the fire tv cube can be controlled with alexa just make sure you have downloaded the roku routine in the alexa app and then run device search to add the ultra punchline the roku ultra is an excellent streaming device the apps work faster and better than the apps within my lg smarttv the apps are also updated far more frequently than the ones installed on the tv the ultra is worth it provided you have or plan to buy a k tv which supports dolby vision and you also have a dolby atmos sound system otherwise the streaming stick is half the price and almost as fast the fire tv options will be fine for you if you mostly watch prime video and are comfortable with the fire tv menu system with all its ads,ordered ultra directly back ordered arrived oct th one day release date using replace ultra model also second k streaming stick well sharp recently tried returned
