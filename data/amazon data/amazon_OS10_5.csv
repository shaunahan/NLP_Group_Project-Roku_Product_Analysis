27,27,R26F702XCD7JN0,BEWARE - PRODUCT WAS NOT NEW,"As other reviewers have mentioned, I also got a clearly used product. I was just upgrading an older Ultra to the 4800X because I needed proper Dolby Atmos passthrough to sound system. Worked fine in that regard, but the box was clearly opened before. Fingerprints were on unit and bottom was dusty from sitting out somewhere. The film protectors were off and stuck to the front of the manual. The twist tie was off the power cord loose in box and the cord looked like it got c08ht in a line trimmer. I just used my old one. Shameful. First time I ever felt ripped off on Amazon. Need it now, so didn't bother with return. Not readily clear if new or used/refurbished in description but the Amazon purchase report tool showed ""New"", so that's how the seller is listing. In any case if it's refurbished, just say so. Probably would have still bought it. But don't outright lie about it or omit the fact. Zero stars. Edit: Within a couple days the remote kept unpairing from the unit. Doesn't happen with any other Roku in the house. Did an exchange. New unit arrived today and was actually new. The box had the original peel seals and the plug wire and such had clearly never been unwrapped. Hopefully this one works.

Even easier since I already have a ROKU account. Connected to a 2015 LG 4K TV. The LG can only be updated to WebOS 2.3, which only plays youtube, Netflix, Prime Video, and nothing else. The ROKU Ultra is snappy in response and plays and loads videos pretty fast. It's on par (speed and load time) with my LG CX OLED. The Roku Ultra has a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor which makes a world of a difference in response time and picture quality. Being the fact the tv is almost 7 years old, Roku produces a pretty 12ent picture compared original from the LG interface and the outdated processor. The remote works well with voice recognition speech to text. Love that I can now have 2 preset buttons ( Youtube and HBOMAX). Another added plus, the Roku remote can power on and off the TV and control the Volume.

215,215,R3QBC448LEPE5J,It’s not Apple TV,"Thought I’d save a few bucks. Put an apple 4K in the den and the roku ultra in the bedroom. There’s really not a comparison. The Apple is vastly better. The only advantage really is the roku remote , but since Apple just redid theirs I’m probably going to replace the roku. The app selection on the Apple is much broader and the interface on Apple makes the roku look cheap. There is no way to turn off the roku ad window that consumes 1/3 of the home page even after jumping through all the ad off hoops in the settings. Another third is taken up by a list of functions that is completely unnecessary. Neither of these things clutter the Apple Home Screen. It takes forever to start the CBS and other live news app, with 10 seconds of buffering, which are instantaneous on the Apple and as others have said the video and audio are frequently out of sync.

235,235,RLC2F8BPFY8KR,WARNING - NO SD Card slot included in this version of the Ultra,"The removal of the SD card slot is not disclosed in the product listing, and should me imo. Previous ultra models had card slots, and this was important to reduce reload (which slows UI/channel load time performance significantly) & and potentially to need to sign in again (which is slow and a bit of a pain, given the lack of support for a true keyboards). Also (as with all Rokus), no built in web browser. (There are work arounds, but they are clumsy.) And no physical keyboard - even on the phone remote app where it would seem to be really easy and natural. Also, there is not way to clone or copy a set of apps and channels from one Roku to another. This 05 not sound like much of a problem, but if you move have to replace a Roku (2 moves, and 3 box replacements for me over ~12 years) you will have to manually reload each of your channels individually, and resign in and re-authenticate to each one. And if you have more than one Roku and use them as your main streamers with cable service which includes multiple premium channels, or if you have more than one subscription service, be aware that you 05 have to sign in and re-authenticate for each channel which depends on your main subscription - on each Roku. So if you have 3 TVs with and a cable service like Charter/Spectrum, plan on spending significant time (re)subscribing to/activating multiple channels on multiple Rokus. Not a deal breaker for sure, but certainly a nuisance, esp after you do it a few times - which is likely in my experience. Other than that it's a 12ent streamer with, just OK UI performance (sluggish at times, esp if a channel has to reload), but support for one of the widest sets of channel options.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLC2F8BPFY8KR?ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,3,True,2.0,2021,12,O.S.10.5,upgraded to this model though i had no issue with my older models now after months it will not display any picture just sound i even purchased a new hdmi cable to no avail i cannot return it so now i am stuck with a non working streaming device supposed to be a known issue on older models yet mine is brand new,upgraded model though issue older models months display picture sound even purchased new hdmi cable avail cannot return stuck non working streaming device supposed known issue older models yet mine brand new,upgrad model though issu older model month display pictur sound even purchas new hdmi cabl avail cannot return stuck non work stream devic suppos known issu older model yet mine brand new

No issues with the WiFi or wired connections, picture looked great on all the TVs I tried them on. Then at the 6 month 03k for one of them and just under a year for the other all hell broke loose. One unit the HDMI port stopped working all together. Obviously it was outside the return time frame for Amazon. The other unit the wired Ethernet port stopped working. So I was forced to use WiFi which would be fine expect i purposely ran Ethernet cable to that spot to be hard wired in and for $99 units I expect things to work for more than a year. Now to the bigger issue. Obviously Amazon can’t do anything for me because it’s a Roku product and it’s outside the return window. So I contact Roku and it has been 3 months of emailing them back and forth. There is NO customer support phone number to speak to anyone. And after I finally get them to understand that these units are defective and agree to replace them I send them back to Roku on my own dime and they send my replacement units to TX.

This Roku has IMDB, Pluto and Roku channels for programs and movies from the past and it will actually read 2TB and (partitioned) 4TB portable hard drives. I was looking for something that I could use if my aged Patriot Box Office stopped working. However, this Roku will not read AVI files. It was fine with mp4, flv, and mkv files. It does have a probably with a few of my mp4 files but I do not know the differentiating factor that causes the problem since it reads most of them. Since the box recognizes what TV I attached to it, I have a feeling it is also gathering a lot more inforamtion about my use of the box in order to make some money from using it. I guess since I cannot skip the ads, it does not know which ones I watch and I ones I ignore. At least its ads are not as depressing as the commercials on OTA old program channels.

250,250,R14PWN23KZ3GA3,Flawed streaming box,"This should be the one-stop answer to all your streaming needs - but it's dogged by technical issues. The upside is that Roku has all the apps you'll ever need, and the user interface and remote are intuitive and straightforward. A principal reason for buying it was that's one of the few devices that allows a hard-wired ethernet connection to a router, so doesn't rely on a wireless signal. Streaming quality is good, through streams of live broadcasts are not as smooth as watching on cable or over an antenna. Now to the technical issues. First, the box crashes every few days: you're left with just a purple screen and no combination of keys on the remote will fix the crash. You have to get up, pull out the power cord and reinsert it, then the Roku will reboot. Second, every 20-30 minutes there is a momentary signal loss between the Roku and the TV. Suddenly, the screen goes black and the sound disappears for a second, then the signal comes back. This is an issue which others have mentioned on Roku-related forums. It's not an internet problem: everything else works fine and as mentioned, I'm connected by ethernet. I've tried changing the TV input used, and the HDMI cable. Nothing stops this happening: a second of total signal loss every 20-30 minutes. This makes viewing on this box extremely irritating. I'd recommend against it: if you want a Roku, choose instead the 4K streaming stick for about seventy bucks less. But I've found that the best streaming quality of all (for 1080p) comes from using a basic cheap Google Chromecast and casting to it using streaming apps downloaded to my iPhone.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14PWN23KZ3GA3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,3,True,2.0,2021,12,O.S.10.5,yes i know how to troubleshoot wifi nuff said,yes know troubleshoot wifi nuff said,ye know troubleshoot wifi nuff said

277,277,R17YKATCVCVKXV,Update:  Audio Issue Resolved,"I’ve had many Roku devices over the years and have a TCL/Roku TV in the bedroom. The screens haven’t changed much over time. The Home Screen remains wonderfully boring. It’s a stagnant display of my apps with an ad on the right side. Such an improvement over the Fire 4K stick which I stopped using due to the overwhelming & annoying barrage of advertising! It’s simply functional. The picture quality of this device is fine. Equal to the Fire stick. The voice search is better than the Fire. But, I have daily issues with the sound. The most frequent issue is static. Sometimes, there are noises that sound like my cat scratching at the glass storm door. Occasionally, there’s no sound at all. I have tried changing sound settings and have used different HDMI cables. But, that hasn’t helped. Going into settings and doing a restart temporarily resolves the problem, but it’s annoying to stop what I’m watching to reboot the Roku. My audio is via a Sony HT-X9000F sound bar. I haven’t had this issue with other devices. I subscribe to Youtube TV which is not supported natively via the Roku. Presently, you have to go into the YouTube app and then select TV from the YouTube menu. It’s currently a minor inconvenience. But, if you’re a YouTube TV subscriber, you 05 wish to check the status of the dispute between the companies before purchasing the Ultra. UPDATE: The audio issue has resolved, and I no longer have to regularly reboot the device. And, Roku has come to an agreement with Google, so both the YouTube and the YouTubeTV apps are available and work just fine. I’ve programmed the “1” button to go directly to YouTubeTV, and it’s very convenient. I am completely happy with this device.

I entered the code on the website that appeared, and it said to call a number to Activate my code. The not U.S. accent scammer on the other end asked for my Amazon password. (No way.) I should have asked for hers. Even though I told them I had a yearly Prime subscription, they said that was only a ""basic subscription"" and wanted $199 for the video use ""for 5 years."" I hung up. THE RIGHT WAY: I should have gone to the exact website by keyboarding it in (which you won't reach without the slash 03k before ""mytv"" but you will get lots of ads that included the scammer). Also, if your cable company (like Comcast/Xfinity) already enables prime, not using Roku for Prime videos is a separate way to view your programs.

290,290,RF05KPY6MFBJ4,DON'T SAY U WERE NOT WARNED.,"Here is what I experienced with this product and IT IS EXACTLY WHAT U WILL GO THRU TO. Bought 1 roku. Worked great and loved it so much we bought another 2 months later. Both working great. Without warning 1 day we tried using BOTH of them and THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT WORK. Researched it and found Roku's software updates rendered the devices BROKEN. We all know that these companies and their so called "" UPDATES "" are actually what causes the problems most times in the first place. This is exactly why I have turned off windows updates many years ago and I have had ZERO problems since. For rokue this would not have been a deal breaker type of problem with the simple ability to "" DISABLE AUTO UPDATES "" or at minimum a "" ROLL BACK "" option. With Roku u have neither, therefore they break your product and u have no recourse as there return policy is very short. Roku is very aware of this and are still selling this product anyway. THAT IS FRAUD. Go to their forums and u will see the HDCP ERROR thread with many people all corroborating what I have said there. There fix is to unplug ALL OF THE CABLES from the roku and the TV EVERY SINGLE TIME U WANT TO USE IT. IF that even fixes it, it will last for an hour or 1 day. Like many on their forum we have tried different ports, different TV's, and different HDMI cables. This is 100% a software/firmware issue. Roku not only lost us forever as a customer.

301,301,R3CQ90R6PRG7QS,Will Take Down Other WiFi Devices,"Heads up. Roku Ultra acts like a king. When running on Wireless WiFi, it likes to be superior and will take over the WiFi as a whole when it is using Wireless WiFi for streaming. It will dominate the bandwidth and literally take down other devices in the process to ensure that it doesn’t have streaming issues. Great if you live alone. Terrible if you have a family and individuals are trying to work, have a class, or a teen is trying to game (I challenge you to take down a teens gaming ability and survive that without teeth 03ks) while running this Roku on Wireless WiFi. It is particularly bad with Nintendo Switches. (Picture lots of yelling and mad children.) The good news is if you don’t use Wireless WiFi, Roku Ultra is great. We used to have an older version of Roku, and upgraded to Ultra. We like everything about it then and still do minus this issue. The older version did not act like a vulture.

313,313,R1FZXK4MDQP440,"Roku fan, but this is very disappointing","I had a first generation Roku as my very first streaming device, and loved it. I replaced it with a Roku 3, and just recently upgraded to the Ultra. I bought mine directly from Roku. I upgraded because I finally had a 12ent WiFi provider that averages 300-400mps. Our old provider (Spectrum) at best was 50-60mps on good days, closer to 10-15mps on average, and other days didn’t work at all. We went through C19 lockdown w/an adult WFM and two remote high school students, and it induced numerous nervous breakdowns. For years and years (8 years? I can’t remember), our Roku 3 almost never failed despite our terrible ISP; we never had trouble buffering, and it would go months and months without needing a reboot. When the Ultra showed up, I moved the Roku 3 to a different room and it still works perfectly. The Ultra? I have to reboot at least twice a night, and if we’re watching Hulu, it reboots itself between episode. I’m aware that’s probably as much Hulu’s fault as Roku, but it’s annoying to have this problem with the streamer my family watches the most. Next - the remote control runs through a pair of AA batteries in 3-5 days, especially if I’m using the headphone jack. I don’t remember changing the batteries on my Roku 3 remote — I’m sure I did a few times in the many years we owned it, but the Ultra flashes a “3% battery” warning sometimes less than an hour after I’ve plugged in headphones. I switched to the Roku-provided earbuds (which aren’t terrible, fwiw) to see if that would make a difference. It hasn’t. Voice control - if I’m on Prime Video, for example, and I say “play Poltergeist,” instead of taking me to Prime’s Poltergeist, it takes me back to a Roku search menu listing the different streaming services where I can watch Poltergeist. As for simple voice commands “play” or “stop,” it’s easier to just hit play or stop buttons. Universal remote function — um, I set this up and followed the instruction and I’ve tried to troubleshoot a few times, but basically the Red on-off button on the Roku remote only turns my tv on and off. If I want to turn on Roku, i have to get up and turn it on with the button on the case. Sometimes if I hit home, it works, but not always. What happened? The Ultra isn’t an upgrade — it’s a joke! Overall, I’m a big Roku fan, but I must have a lemon. After 30 days, i am a ending it back, and will happily use my Roku 3 until the new one arrives. Once again, with digital equipment, there’s no point in upgrading until you absolutely have to.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FZXK4MDQP440/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,2,False,4.0,2021,11,O.S.10.5,the roku channel has turned into the cable network we all dumped the commercials atleast commercials per minute episode exhaust your data plan now i have black voices banner displaying woke movies annie isn t a black movie lol unbelievable how media is trying to push this stupidity this will be my last roku purchase looking to support a non agenda company in the future,channel turned cable network dumped commercials atleast commercials per minute episode exhaust data plan black voices banner displaying woke movies annie black movie lol unbelievable media trying push stupidity last purchase looking support non agenda company future,channel turn cabl network dump commerci atleast commerci per minut episod exhaust data plan black voic banner display woke movi anni black movi lol unbeliev media tri push stupid last purchas look support non agenda compani futur

Can't Roku come out with a simple firmware fix for this irritating problem. This is supposed to be the Cadillac of Rokus, and they can't provide consistant audio streams.

I'd been using the Amazon 4k stick for some time and seeing as how the Roku Ultra went on sale, coupled with the fact that the Amazon products usually get apps after Roku or had been more buggy in my experience, I 12ided to ""upgrade"". I've had older Roku devices and even a Roku TV that I was perfectly happy with, but there were issues right out of the box with the Ultra that based on other reviews and forum posts, seems to be common with this model. After having used the unit for an evening and having multiple audio drops and dhcp errors, and jumping through all the hoops with different hdmi ports and cables, resets, unplugs, and the like, the unit was boxed up and sent back. My 4k stick might have its issues, but they're no where near as bad as the Roku Ultra. UPDATE- Got a replacement just to ensure I didn't get a lemon and right off the bat there were issues with it connecting to both the wireless and wired networks. Once that issue was resolved, the dhcp issue was still present and on this unit it was actually worse and happened with more frequency than on the one it replaced. I'm done with Roku.

Roku is still my favorite, especially this one. The 3 killer features that set this one apart are (1) button on base unit that makes the remote beep to help find it, (2) headphone jack in the remote for private audio, and (3) offline support. We lose our remotes regularly, fire stick or Roku, so this first note has easily become our favorite feature of all time and table stakes for any new streaming device we bring into the house. Since we also tend to group together in the family room, the kids playing nicely with toys on the ground, someone else on a conference call on their laptop, and now I can still watch TV without disturbing anyone else. Plugging headphones into the 3.5mm jack in the side of the remote disables audio that gets output through HDMI. Finally, when our ISP has issues but our home wifi still works, Roku allows us to still stream in-home via Plex and other no internet options. This was a VERY unexpected and unpleasant surprise we found with our fire sticks. Internet outage is something for which we have contingencies, but it helps to have a platform that actually supports those contingencies too.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YLXW67835Z93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,11,O.S.10.5,dislike the hdcp error we keep getting and having to unplug everything at least twice a day to even watch the tv,dislike hdcp error keep getting unplug everything least twice day even watch,dislik hdcp error keep get unplug everyth least twice day even watch

Starts much faster than Fire TV Cube thanks to the amazing Quad Core Processor and OS. Apps open quickly, as they should with no lag.

377,377,R2WFM08BJPE0F5,Powerful and very fast,"Bought the Roku Ultra 2021 version to replace my Samsung S03t 4K TV of six years as the TV had become too slow and development of new Apps was pretty much gone as Samsung wants one to buy a new TV. Since I have switched my TVs in the house as they die to Roku TVs I got the ROKU Ultra to use with the Samsung in question. No complains does everything, and does it extremely fast. No more annoyance with using Samsung with lag and missing Apps like Apple TV, and others. I do have some display issues with Roku keeping the Samsung on 4K but since the majority of the content I watch is not 4K its not an issue as I can manually select 4K from the display setting when needed. Likely the age of the TV and Roku having some talking (hand shake) issues. Unlike my older Ultra from 2017 which had the flashing black screen all the time it seems Roku fixed the issue on the 2021 models. For any user using a Bose Cinemate 130 make sure you have an Optical cable and do not connect the Roku Ultra into the Bose Console as the HMDI ports on the Bose are HDMI 1.4 which will cause Roku to never see your TV as having 4K. I had this issue till I by passed the Bose with just using the Optical cable for the audio.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WFM08BJPE0F5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,10,O.S.10.5,we had our previous unit since ish not realizing how our outdated unit was effecting the speed of our streaming channels loading and the clarity plus sound until we updated i cannot speak for other units as this was a major upgrade for us disney was crashing every time we attempted to watch b we updated and other channels looked blurry for minutes or so after loading all these issues plus a ton of others vanished after we installed every channel is crystal clear now all channels load super quick the sound is awesome i heard other units don t allow u to view youtube channel however this version does and the clarity is soooo much better too glad we upgraded and wished we would ve done it sooner,previous unit since ish realizing outdated unit effecting speed streaming channels loading clarity plus sound updated cannot speak units major upgrade us disney crashing every time attempted watch b updated channels looked blurry minutes loading issues plus ton others vanished installed every channel crystal clear channels load super quick sound awesome heard units allow u view youtube channel however version clarity soooo much better glad upgraded wished would done sooner,previou unit sinc ish realiz outdat unit effect speed stream channel load clariti plu sound updat cannot speak unit major upgrad us disney crash everi time attempt watch b updat channel look blurri minut load issu plu ton other vanish instal everi channel crystal clear channel load super quick sound awesom heard unit allow u view youtub channel howev version clariti soooo much better glad upgrad wish would done sooner

380,380,R88UEHC9UW4H2,When your S03t TV 12ides to be dumb. This is a great alternative.,"The Roku Ultra 4K really saved the day for us. Our Samsung 55 in S03t TV was designed in 2017 or 2018, and had begun to give warnings about memory storage when Streaming apps were updating. Turns out Samsung only put an SSD in there that is ~1 GB. Nowhere near big enough, and unswappable. Samsung also made the problem impossible to rectify because the apps it preloads onto your S03t TV are 99% of the time unremovable. So the SSD is bloated with what apps Samsung got paid to package into the set and you can't remove them. So what we now have is a 55 Inch 4K Samsung Monitor. Instead of buying a whole new S03t TV, We went with the Roku Ultra for the 4K HDMI, and because the unit has a feature where you can press a button on it to have the remote beep until you locate it. For our quality of life, that locator is a needed feature. Roku has other products that can get you 4K streaming for a little less if you don't need it. Setup was made so much easier by downloading the Roku Remote control App, which gave one the ability to use a tablet or s03tphone TO TYPE IN PASSWORDS instead of using crossbars, arrow keys, and menu buttons. If this Roku is ever not up to storing all the streaming apps we use, we will only be out $100ish bucks to buy the next top-of-the-line Roku upgrade, and Roku also makes it pretty easy to remove undesired apps like 85% of the time. So it solved the problem we had in the first place for less than a new TV We won.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R88UEHC9UW4H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,3.0,2021,10,O.S.10.5,when i tried to add amazon prime it rejected it pop up a telephone number to call by the time the call was over i lost over joe,tried add prime rejected pop telephone number call time call lost joe,tri add prime reject pop telephon number call time call lost joe

It connects wirelessly but for the amount I paid it should connect with a wire. My Nvidia Shield and s03t tv have no problems with wired connection in same port. During my research some said many routers simply won’t work for whatever every reason and even posted some of the routers that WILL work. I have a $400 router currently, I’m not buying a new router to fix the issue. Google the problem and even on roku’s help page you will see 6 pages of people with same problem of Ethernet connection not working.

Also, it has a USB port so that I can display my photos as a slide show. The installation was very easy. Essentially, I plugged it into the existing HDMI 2.0 cable that was connected to my previous Roku and plugged it into the outlet. It took several iterations, however, to get the Roku to stream 4K HDR Dolby Vision to the television. First, I had to uninstall and then reinstall each of my apps on the Roku; that seemed to help, particularly with Netflix and Amazon Prime channels. Also I rebooted the Roku a couple of times, even after installing all the driver updates, in order to get the Roku to finally output Dolby Vision to the television. Finally, it is working as expected and has been very stable for the week that I have had it.

Not even the expensive duracells last 6 days. By the time, I had tried different types of batteries and switching it to another roku device, the return window for Amazon had closed. So my only recourse is to try to go through Roku itself.
