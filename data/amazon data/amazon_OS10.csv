479,479,R3M2PQFCPZ4NME,Mine stopped working after 2 months,"The Roku Ultra worked great until it died after two months. This is unacceptable. The problem here was the bouncing Roku logo on the start up screen was stuck there. The logo just kept on bouncing and making the noise. I contacted the company to help me solve the problem. They could not solve the problem. They put in a ""request"" that needs to be approved before I get instructions to return my current broken one with a replacement free of charge. I would not pay again to get a new Roku Ultra. I will move on to a different company if they don't give me a replacement. Other than that, the Roku Ultra worked great. It was fast, the UI is ok, could be improved, the voice remote for searching is convenient but you need to speak extremely clear into it for it to work properly. And the headphones are super useful too. The remote drains batteries like a starving child. If you're not using the remote for long periods of time, I suggest you remove them, or get rechargeable batteries. Something I learned is that the Roku is ALWAYS on. I find this sort of feature to be pointless. They do have an explanation for why, but I found it to be poor programming. The Roku Ultra gets pretty warm, and it has no fans or air vents. I feel this could be one culprit for faulty Roku's, besides poor programming. ---------------------------- Update: 9/20/2021: After a week of waiting for the email to begin my replacement, I emailed them again to remind them that my issue was still not resolved, and that seemed to do the trick to have them give me the information. Of course I have to pay for shipping, and be responsible for getting a tracking number for it. ---------------------------- Update: 10/14/2021: After sending it out. I waited the 3-5 business days. Never came. So I chatted with someone on the Roku website and told them that my replacement never arrived. ---------------------------- Update: 10/20/2021: Finally my replacement Roku arrived. Two of them. Not sure why they sent two, but I'm happy for the extra one. ---------------------------- Update: 11/21/2021: So far so good. ---------------------------- It seemed I had to hold their hand the entire process.

525,525,R24TMMCRIT8SAF,Terrible Speed,"There are a few nice features to the Roku ultra. What drew me to this in the first place is the number of platforms to which it can connect. Big plus there. I prefer the app availability on Roku over some of the other streaming devices. And I like the interface. I like the ability to check speeds pretty easily. The remote is pretty simple. And I like the ability to plug-in some headphones to the remote (although that runs the batteries down a good bit). There are several negatives with the Roku, however. The Wireless (WiFi) connectivity is pretty poor. Even when it tells me that I have an excellent signal strength and connection, my Internet download speed maxes out at about 50 Mbps. Typically it’s between 43 to 47. This is frankly unacceptable. My phone Wi-Fi runs about 190 Mbps, and the same for my computer. Even when I turn Wi-Fi off on both my phone and computer - with no one else on my secured network - the max Wi-Fi download I have been able to get for the Roku is 51 Mbps. What is even more disappointing is that I 12ided to buy a Cat 7 ethernet line in order to connect directly with my modem and speed things up (incidentally, it’s the same Cat 7 connection I use for my wife modem which gives my other devices up to 200 mbps). When I connected using the Cat 7, the max speed I have been able to get (trying multiple times) was 44 Mbps. Does all that matter? Well, yes. The Roku struggles with certain apps such as HBO Max, and it slows down a lot on Amazon prime app. It generally does pretty well with YouTube TV but even then that can have problems. So, there are two fundamental problems here. First, the Wi-Fi is too slow relative to my other devices. Second, the ethernet, which should provide a more reliable and much faster connection, is even slower than the Wi-Fi!!! Generally speaking the Roku is reliable except for its slow speeds which can impact reliability. So it’s a very mixed bag with the Roku and I’m only giving it two stars. Roku needs to improve its ethernet connection and it’s Wi-Fi.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24TMMCRIT8SAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,2,False,,2021,8,O.S.10.0,old roku stopped working and unfortunately we have to unplug this one when it is not in use or else it will make a terrible noise when turned on otherwise works as expected,old stopped working unfortunately unplug one use else make terrible noise turned otherwise works expected,old stop work unfortun unplug one use els make terribl nois turn otherwis work expect

It is so worth it and even then some.You won’t regret getting this model. I love the remote and that if we’re not sure where we can find a certain movie or series we can talk into the remote and it locates it for us, giving you a choice of what channel you can watch it on. Some are for free and some you would pay a small fee. But I love how it gives you that choice. And if it’s free on a channel I haven’t download it, I’ll back up, download that channel and then go back and search for what I want and watch it for free on that the newly added channel.

534,534,R23YMFDVAYSMCY,Don't buy if you want the YouTube TV app,"Honestly, I wouldn't have bought this if I'd been aware of the contractual spat between Roku and Google over YouTube TV--I've got two older Rokus, and both still have the app. I had a mild panic attack when I set this up and couldn't find the app in the channel store, since that's mostly how we watch. Turns out there's a workaround: It's a few extra clicks, but subscribers can now access YouTube TV on Roku via the free YouTube app, which for reasons I don't understand is still available on Roku. I wasn't about to cast programs from my phone or laptop on a daily basis, but I can live with this. (Since, for the moment, I pretty much have to.) No idea if Roku and Google will work out their differences. If not, and I'm forced to choose, I'd go with YouTube TV in a heartbeat. Not that I love Google. But I do like YouTube TV. And I wouldn't mind switching from a platform that doesn't even give you the option of changing the locked-in, sponsored channel buttons on the remote. All that said, the Roku Ultra works better than my older, cheaper models, which have a tendency to hang up in heavy wi-fi traffic.

The Ultra performs very well, 03ginally faster than the Streaming Stick, too. They have added a ""light"" model of the Ultra that lacks the headphone jack and remote finder. And they're now selling a remote with headphone jack and rechargeable battery as a separate $30 product. If you get the Ultra and some Eneloop batteries (I use them everywhere in my house), you'll have all that and simply swap rechargeable batteries when needed rather than having to stop using the remote to recharge the internal batteries.

563,563,RIBFCMF6Z3221,Pays for itself if currently renting from Xfinity,"Purchased this to replace a Xfinity cable box rental (download the Xfinity Streaming app) - this will pay for itself by EOY. I'm not a cable-cutter, but tired of ""renting"" equipment. Since I've wired with Cat6 Ethernet I won't buy any device w/o Ethernet connector, which Ultra has. With Ethernet/Cat6/1G-internet, there's absolutely no streaming difference from the Xfinity box. Remote: One tradeoff - I have Xfinity DVR, which I use a lot. (Note: Xfinity DVR service requires one pri03y box in the house, so I use Roku on a 2nd TV.) With the Xfinity box, the Xfinity remote gives additional playback controls. But I'll give those up to stop renting. One win - love the earphone plugin. I use it regularly to listen without disturbing others. This feature will be better if Roku adds Bluetooth so I can use wireless earbuds. One tip - There are two buttons for setting up ""custom"" actions. It's brilliant the way Roku designed these. You program each button to repeat any viable voice command. I use one button to launch Xfinity Streaming and the other to fast-forward 3 minutes. I DVR a lot of sports - typical sports commercial break is about 3 minutes.

that is compatible with netflix s unusual implementation of dolby atmos most streaming services use dolby digital plus dd for their pri y audio stream and include additional metadata that dolby atmos receivers can ode this means that almost any streaming device can pass on dolby atmos encoded soundtracks and your receiver either knows what to do with it or just ignores it netflix doesn t support this configuration instead the atmos soundtrack must be oded inside the streaming device and then sent to the receiver there are a handful of devices that can ode netflix s atmos data and the roku ultra is one of them just having an atmos compatible receiver and roku ultra isn t enough to hear certain netflix shows and films in atmos you also need to pay extra to netflix for them to even send the atmos signal this is not roku s fault but netflix s not all netflix films and shows are even produced with an atmos soundtrack and not all netflix programs with atmos are of interest to me so what i m getting at is there might be a very small amount of content even worth the trouble of attempting to jump through netflix s atmos hoops it does work though a little bit of the dolby atmos compatible programs from netflix did sound much better and immersive than the non atmos versions much of it sounded about the same if you have a modern receiver that includes the latest version of dolby surround and dts neural x then you will get upconverted immersive surround from most shows and movies that are comparable to the discreet native audio from netflix there are a small handful of times when what i heard in atmos on netflix was drastically better than the dolby surround or dts neural x upconverted versions none of this is why i returned my roku ultra i returned it because the video quality is a major downgrade from past versions of the streaming box the version of roku ultra has built in edge enhancement sharpening which is non defeatable my television set is professionally calibrated and the sharpness setting is turned all the way down as part of this calibration video from the version of the roku ultra looks almost three dimensional regardless of the content being p i or uhd video from the version looks busy and distracting due to the artificial sharpening with halos around all edges it looks especially bad around text hair eyes grasses and foliage forests really look like a mess i was no longer able to be immersed into the picture but instead my brain was busy trying to ipher what this over sharpened mess was supposed to be it gets worse the roku ultra has a problem with frame per second content not always not most of the time but enough to be a semi regular distraction it manifests this problem in a really strange way every once in a while frame content is slowed down and jerky with an effect that looks a little like the scene from the empire strikes back where luke has a lightsaber battle with vader in the weird hollow tree on dagobah then almost as soon as it shows up video returns to regular speed at all times sound is in synch with the video be it is dropping some frames i don t know the cause and if you back the same scene up sometimes it is in normal speed and sometimes it becomes jerky again it seems to be a little random i plugged my roku ultra back in and immediately i was sucked into the perfect picture once again the video looked flawless on everything i watched both in smoothness in motion and quality of details i stopped analyzing the video because it just looked so natural i regretted not being able to hear a couple of netflix shows i like in atmos but could not tolerate watching them with such picture video quality the slight sacrifice in audio quality is a tiny price to pay for the superior picture quality that the version of the roku ultra provides on a completely side note going into the secret menus looking for a way to turn off edge enhancement i noticed that the ultra runs cooler than the version also the version has a milliamp power supply while the version has a milliamp power supply the version has a remote control that can control the volume via wi fi whereas the version uses infrared to change the volume with the version you don t have to point the remote anywhere with the version you need to point it at the infrared remote receiver for volume changes the remote control does add a power button the remote control retains its un ergonomic shape of past roku devices that never quite fits naturally in the hand and tends to roll off of un level surfaces such as sofa cushions roku usually comes out with new versions of their devices confusingly under the same model names each autumn be the roku ultra will fix the unacceptable problems created by the box i strongly recommend not purchasing this defective streaming unit until roku comes out with a box that works correctly or issues a recall,purchased ultra one devices compatible netflix unusual

The reason for my purchasing the Ultra was to have an actual wired Ethernet connection and a USB port capable of playing the same USB flash drive music that I use happily in a 2018 Honda Fit. And, it started off really well with the Roku Media Player doing everything that the Honda did including doing a shuffle across all stored music. Slowly though, with every Roku update, features for playing the audio flash drive were lost so that now the Roku Media Player will only play USB stored music for about 20 minutes before the remote’s forward button needs to be pressed to move it along. Addendum (12-29-21): After about 6-months, and various new Roku updates, the Roku Media Player is again working quite nicely. It no longer stalls out playing a series of .WAV files.

596,596,RF9JMN8N7KKNV,Solid Fire Stick/Cube Alternative But Not a Replacement,"If you're not already invested in a 4k fire stick or fire cube this is a solid alternative. No additional ethernet adapter is required so that's a plus if you prefer to hardwire your connection like a lot of people do. The interface is a little cleaner/more intuitive than the fire stick as well; I didn't find myself being led to content that I couldn't actually stream for free nearly as much. I've heard complaints about an audio/video sync issue with the fire stick, which I've experienced myself, I did not notice that with the Roku Ultra. In all fairness I only used the Roku for about a week and typically I've noticed my syncing issues seem to occur as the fire stick begins to run lower on available storage. It works with Alexa and can turn the TV on/off, lower/raise volume, etc assuming you have an HDMI-CEC input. All in all I was very happy with the Roku Ultra however being that I already had a 4k fire stick there wasn't enough of a difference to justify having them both. Final verdict: if you don't currently own any streaming device you can't go wrong with the Roku Ultra.

615,615,RKKDBXI9TOYTA,Wow.  SOOOO much better than my Fire devices.,"...not sure Bezos will let this review stand, but omg after years with a Fire TV, Fire TV Cube, and three Fire TV Sticks, I just sort of assumed streaming devices kinda sucked and were meant to be slow and unresponsive. Nope! This thing is fantastic, so far has all of my streaming services, and has about a bajillion times better wi-fi signal than the fire stick that's right next to it. Who knew the menus were actually supposed to be responsive? I didn't! I've had fire devices for *years* and really assumed it just was how it was, since there had been zero improvement using their newer devices... This thing is WAY better. LOVE love love the headphone-on-the-remote feature, it's super helpful when people are visiting/talking and I'm in the middle of binging. =) Love that it supports so far all of my streaming services. Love that it actually takes advantage of my house wi-fi. If I just *had* to ask for changes? The volume and mute buttons on the side of the remove... somewhere else please, *anywhere* else... I keep accidentally hitting them. Oh, and the ability to remove the two default roku channels would be nice. 05be there is a way? I dunno. Oh, and the ability to resize the screen just a bit, HBO Max is slightly off screen.

631,631,R7UXU4R0JMYOJ,Significant downgrade in picture quality from the 2018 Roku Ultra,"I purchased the 2020 Roku Ultra because it is one of the few devices that is compatible with Netflix's unusual implementation of Dolby Atmos. Most streaming services use Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) for their pri03y audio stream, and include additional metadata that Dolby Atmos receivers can 12ode. This means that almost any streaming device can pass on Dolby Atmos encoded soundtracks and your receiver either knows what to do with it or just ignores it. Netflix doesn't support this configuration; instead, the Atmos soundtrack must be 12oded inside the streaming device and then sent to the receiver. There are a handful of devices that can 12ode Netflix's Atmos data, and the 2020 Roku Ultra is one of them. Just having an Atmos compatible receiver and 2020 Roku Ultra isn't enough to hear certain Netflix shows and films in Atmos; you also need to pay extra to Netflix for them to even send the Atmos signal. This is not Roku's fault, but Netflix's. Not all Netflix films and shows are even produced with an Atmos soundtrack, and not all Netflix programs with Atmos are of interest to me. So what i'm getting at is there might be a very small amount of content even worth the trouble of attempting to jump through netflix's Atmos hoops. It does work though. A little bit of the Dolby Atmos compatible programs from Netflix did sound much better and immersive than the non-Atmos versions. Much of it sounded about the same. If you have a modern receiver that includes the latest version of Dolby Surround and DTS Neural X, then you will get upconverted immersive surround from most shows and movies that are comparable to the discreet native audio from Netflix. There are a small handful of times when what I heard in Atmos on Netflix was drastically better than the Dolby Surround or DTS Neural X upconverted versions. None of this is why I returned my 2020 Roku Ultra. I returned it because the video quality is a major downgrade from past versions of the streaming box. The 2020 version of Roku Ultra has built-in edge enhancement (sharpening) which is non-defeatable. My television set is professionally calibrated and the sharpness setting is turned all the way down as part of this calibration. Video from the 2018 version of the Roku Ultra looks almost three dimensional regardless of the content being 720p, 1080i, or UHD. Video from the 2020 version looks busy and distracting due to the artificial sharpening, with halos around all edges. It looks especially bad around text, hair, eyes, grasses, and foliage. Forests really look like a mess. I was no longer able to be immersed into the picture, but instead my brain was busy trying to 12ipher what this over-sharpened mess was supposed to be. It gets worse. The Roku 2020 Ultra has a problem with 24 frame per second content. Not always, not most of the time; but enough to be a semi-regular distraction. It manifests this problem in a really strange way. every once in a while, 24 frame content is slowed down and jerky, with an effect that looks a little like the scene from The Empire Strikes back where Luke has a lightsaber battle with Vader in the weird hollow tree on Dagobah. Then, almost as soon as it shows up, video returns to regular speed. At all times, sound is in synch with the video. 05be it is dropping some frames? I don't know the cause, and if you back the same scene up, sometimes it is in normal speed, and sometimes it becomes jerky again. It seems to be a little random. I plugged my 2018 Roku Ultra back in, and immediately I was sucked into the perfect picture. Once again the video looked flawless on everything I watched, both in smoothness in motion and quality of details. I stopped analyzing the video because it just looked so natural. I regretted not being able to hear a couple of Netflix shows I like in Atmos, but could not tolerate watching them with such picture video quality. The slight sacrifice in audio quality is a tiny price to pay for the superior picture quality that the 2018 version of the Roku Ultra provides. On a completely side note, going into the secret menus (looking for a way to turn off edge enhancement) I noticed that the 2020 Ultra runs cooler than the 2018 version. Also, the 2020 version has a 1.5 milliamp power supply, while the 2018 version has a 1.0 milliamp power supply. The 2018 version has a remote control that can control the volume via Wi-Fi, whereas the 2020 version uses infrared to change the volume. With the 2018 version, you don't have to point the remote anywhere, with the 2020 version, you need to point it at the infrared remote receiver for volume changes. The 2020 remote control does add a power button. The remote control retains its un-ergonomic shape of past Roku devices that never quite fits naturally in the hand and tends to roll off of un-level surfaces such as sofa cushions. Roku usually comes out with new versions of their devices (confusingly under the same model names) each autumn. 05be the 2021 Roku Ultra will fix the unacceptable problems created by the 2020 box. I strongly recommend not purchasing this defective streaming unit until Roku comes out with a box that works correctly or issues a recall.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7UXU4R0JMYOJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,1,True,2.0,2021,7,O.S.10.0,for a few years i ve been using two roku ultras in house to stream tv with my cable provider last week one of my rokus got zapped by lightning i ordered a replacement from amazon and it arrived in two days went to install and configure this am can t get the spectrum app called cable and they told me roku provides the app i call roku explain that i have ultras one new and need to install spectrum app on new device they tell me thy are no longer allowing roku users to install spectrum if you have existing device and app you can use you cannot install if you buy a new device apparently this has become rokus normal mode of operation there are numerous complaints on their web site regarding other streaming service providers you can no longer install they eive the general public to believe their product supports most stream providers but reality is they drop support after you invest in their product i will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau sending a letter to roku management about their tactics snd returning roku to amazon for full refund do not buy any roku products,years using two ultras house stream cable provider last week one rokus got zapped lightning ordered replacement arrived two days went install configure get spectrum app called cable told provides app call explain ultras one new need install spectrum app new device tell thy longer allowing users install spectrum existing device app use cannot install buy new device apparently become rokus normal mode operation numerous complaints web site regarding streaming service providers longer install eive general public believe product supports stream providers reality drop support invest product filing complaint better business bureau sending letter management tactics snd returning full refund buy products,year use two ultra hous stream cabl provid last week one roku got zap lightn order replac arriv two day went instal configur get spectrum app call cabl told provid app call explain ultra one new need instal spectrum app new devic tell thi longer allow user instal spectrum exist devic app use cannot instal buy new devic appar becom roku normal mode oper numer complaint web site regard stream servic provid longer instal eiv gener public believ product support stream provid realiti drop support invest product file complaint better busi bureau send letter manag tactic snd return full refund buy product

When I turn it on I get a black screen and I have to then hit the 'ok' button to have it go to the home screen. (not how the older model worked) It seems to take forever to scroll through everything!

644,644,R2LWO4V2EOD1SF,Best Streaming Box... But Not Perfect,"Generally great. I was tired of my PS5 not having incredibly basic streaming apps on it, and didn't want to pay the Apple tax just to stream things in 4K, so I took a chance on this during a sale. It's paid off well. 4K quality is great (I'm wired in, can't attest for wifi), it's responsive, and I love the hefty but light remote and it's easy to use buttons. The only downside is that you cannot manually power it down. I don't know why, it goes through a speedy boot-up process when you plug it back in, seems like they easily could have added that in. I just don't like vampire devices sapping juice, even if in ""low power mode"" (which I don't totally buy, when you're running a CG fish tank screensaver nonstop), so I've taken to just unplugging it at night. Hopefully, eventually, they add this feature in.

streaming player with all the options we re definitely power users at my house this has an extra powerful wi fi if you are going to stay wireless and also supports wired ethernet without an extra dongle firetv if you ve wired your house with cat ethernet like me i already have a k tv with lg os a firetv stick and even a tivo romio pro that streams when my lg tv firetv tivo use wi fi they spend noticeably more time opening apps and opening shows than when connected via wired with this roku the wi fi seems nearly no different i still connected it via ethernet in the end but was surprised how equivalent wi fi seemed compared to my past experiences its hardware is fast and reliable such that i ve never perceived a delay induced by the hardware easy to configure out of the box too the menus and channels are really easy to navigate and easy on my eyes and it supports seemingly all relevant audio and video formats like dolby vision dolby atmos which it audio detects level of hdr support in your tv the remote is probably is probably its most multi faceted and yet simple and intuitive solution it has volume buttons or mute on the right side by your thumb it has a headphone jack on the left for silent watching if you don t want to disturb others it is an rf remote meaning you can tuck the roku away in a cabinet or behind a tv and it will still work without line of sight but the roku does have an ir sensor if you have another ir remote too and most of the buttons are what you d expect on a modern streamer but feels simple easy and intuitive to use the skip back button like my tivo button is something i use a lot such as if i missed something or didn t hear them quite right surprisingly by default it displays closed captioning subtitle on the replay so you can see what they said if you were backing it up but you can turn that off cc on rewind if you rewind often and don t want the distraction of text and the voice command button and subsequent command processing is surprisingly good you can even say things like skip forward minutes or whatever and you can even save your last voice command in one of the two numbered buttons by holding one after and then repeats that command if you touch it again i actually use that a lot to skip for ward seconds however some possible minor negatives are there is no second instant skip forward button on the remote but you can use a voice command to skip any amount of time you want including seconds and can store that in one of the configurable buttons it just isn t exactly instant skip while it processes the command but close enough pausing and resuming leave the screen darkened and showing the progress bar and controls and takes a few seconds to resume normal brightness of the show or movie that irks me compared to my lg tv that the back button can hide the bar so i can instantly be back into my show in its full picture streaming apps vary by platform so don t expect them to be identical for example i really like the netflix app on my lg tv for and for fast forwarding that can click right or left through easy picture snapshots rather than a traditional fast forward or rewind that appears in the roku version of the same app the volume buttons on the right side of the remote are easy to accidentally press if you aren t careful but doesn t really get in the way if it doesn t detect dolby vision double check that the device it is directly connected to supports it on that hdmi input definitely not the fault of this device but it puzzled me for a while why it didn t detect dolby vision at first when my tv supports it the tv did but the hdmi input on my blu ray player didn t roku supports the widest channel library that i am aware of and is the reason i bought this for hbo max i use this when i want the best sound support to go through my sound system and it delivers a noticeable sound improvement in my home compared to my tv connected back to my a v receiver i actually have this plugged

didn t support a lot of apps such as hbo i wanted the ultra model for the usb port and the speed and it has both apps install and uninstall very quickly and load quickly as well if an app is still in memory it loads instantaneously the menu interface is similar to the simplicity of the sony although the roku does have ads on the home screens contrary to their keting and other literature however this seems unavoidable on modern streaming devices so i ll settle for the lesser evil they don t have sound at least i appreciated being able to customize the menu to some extent and setting the two customizable buttons on the remote was a breeze the voice control on the remote is also helpful in lieu of typing in searches but i haven t found it too useful otherwise it doesn t seem to know much in terms of functions the ability to sync it with my tv to control the tv volume and power was very easy and it didn t take long for it to find a right match the roku device has a button on the side that is intended to initiate a sound on the remote in order to find it but this feature does not work if you check out roku s support forums they broke this feature with a software update over a year ago and have yet to fix it i was only able to get it to work by using the remote to go into the device s settings and use its test function obviously if i m looking for the remote i won t be able to activate the sound that way the setup on this device was a pain and took hours and i d say i have a reasonable amount of tech experience for one thing trying to get it on my ghz wireless network was impossible for whatever reason the roku ultra was designed to only support some channels and not others unlike any other wireless device i ve ever used which just works with whatever standard it is supposed to work with roku s website indicates you have to go into your wireless router settings not readily navigable for your average user and manually set the channel the problem is not all routers support manually setting the channel even in advanced mode mine does not my only option was to put the roku on the slower ghz network if your roku happens to be in close physical proximity to your router you could use the ethernet port instead then when i went to test the usb functions on the device i was utterly baffled that it does not support the most common format for modern external drives exfat even my outdated sony player supported that their website even acknowledges that many new usb drives are pre formatted with the exfat file system which is not supported so then instead of using my normal media usb drive i had to find an old one i had and format it in ntfs to use it since i have video files over gb ntfs is the only option on my windows computer available that the roku device supports my final gripe is that the led on the front is bright and not adjustable like it is on some of roku s other devices via their device menu or secret menu black electrical tape over the led

729,729,R2QN78APSFFV2W,The top of the line Roku and better than prior generation Ultra..fixed receiver sound issues.,"We had a Roku Ultra in our family room and bedroom. The Ultra in our family room was having an issue with the AT&T app recordings. Every 10 seconds, we would lose a second of sound. The system is hooked up to a nice Yamaha receiver that has its firmware up to date, we are using the latest generation HDMI cables and for the life us we could not figure out what was going on. We took the unit off and plugged it in to one of the other sets and all would be fine so we realized that the older Ultra did not like or could not play along nicely with our receiver...there were compatibility issues. However, the new Ultra advertises updated Dolby digital sound features which fixed the problem!!!

Unfortunately this unit doesn't have the connectivity to support streaming the media it supposedly supports unless you load the media directly on to it. It's still stuck on 100mbit ethernet and the Wi-Fi isn't much faster, so there isn't enough bandwidth to actually stream any Dolby Vision 2160p content as it will consume more than 100mbit/s during playback unless you take the time to transcode to a much lower quality which defeats the purpose.

748,748,R2IKMLI37QJOFG,Amazing experience with 4800 Bluetooth model,"I'll start by saying this is the best overall 4K streaming device out of the 3 I own. Pros: - Steady and smooth performance of 4K content. Even with 3rd party apps that uses video overlay for displaying ads, the performance is great, other devices always glitches and slow down with ads overlay. - Truly plug and play, less than 5 mins to get it up and running. - Non locked eco-system. Supports almost all popular channels and apps out there, including the ones you have payment processing. I'm very happy to have Vudu, Prime and Fandango all working in the same device so I can rent/buy content as I please. Other devices with locked eco-systems prioritize their own content and payment processing options, making some apps unavailable to avoid competition and payment issues, not this one. - Bluetooth and audio controls. Bluetooth on this is great, steady streaming and so far compatible with 100% of my devices including 2 Headphones. Audio controls and jack on the remote are pretty handy. - Video upscaling works well. When set for 4k display, if you watch content with lower resolution, like 1080p, 720p, 480p, it uses upscaling instead of changing the display resolution, the advantage of this is depending on your TV or Monitor, you won't have weird black screens between things you start and stop watching and won't have issues with loosing display setting or weird aliasing effects. Cons: - User Interface. It works and the user experience overall is smooth. But it doesn't look great and the menus hierarchy are pretty strange, generating some unnecessary extra steps getting to and back from content. - No keyboard support. There's no easy way to set up a keyboard, they prioritized voice commands, but completely forgot people that can't speak. Making typing, login and searching a painful experience. It has bluetooth, so it should at least support bluetooth keyboards, but it doesn't. I tried 2.

769,769,R8FERH5PNNZGY,Horrible Interface and Too Slow,"I have had a FireTV Box for many years, then switched to an Apple TV 4K because the Fire TV slows way down so that you have to keep buying new ones. When both entered into politics, I switched to the Roku Ultra 2020 to get rid of the Apple and Amazon interfaces. I like the Roku remote vs the other two. It fits the hand better, and the fact that it has a power button releases me from having to have my TV remote available as well. Then for as much as I tried to like Roku, the interface is horrible. I shouldn't have to select a show or movie, to see the rating, year, run time, and the description. There's plenty of screen real estate to show all the info I want to see by highlighting a show or movie while browsing for something to watch without having to select it. The Amazon Prime and Apple TV interface do this very well. This alone dives me away from Roku. Another very aggravating issue with Roku is the fact that it always starts back at the home screen. I have a bunch of pay services such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, and so on, and I better pay attention to where I was while watching a show or movie when I 12ide to stop and finish it later. With Roku, I have no idea where I was or what I was watching if it's a day or two later. The Amazon interface will always come back up where I left off. Another huge complaint I have with the Roku is the speed, especially when trying to skip backwards to replay what I just saw or forwards to skip ahead 10 seconds or more. Roku takes forever! Often it never does get there and just sits forever with the spinning circle telling you it's working on it. I am hearing impaired and use closed captioning, and often have to skip back 10 seconds for a replay. Roku fails MISERABLY at this. So, sad to say as I paid $80 for this Roku, I switched back to the Apple TV with it's lightning fast speed and the Amazon Prime interface, and I just received the new Apple TV Remote which I like way better than the original too-small remote with the super-sensitive touch pad.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8FERH5PNNZGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,2,False,,2021,6,O.S.10.0,roku s have always been the cheapest and most diverse of the media streamers i got this one for only and it has way more memory better ghz wifi a usb port for external media and the feature i love the most a lost remote finder that sounds your choice of three loud sounds from the remote i m so glad i upgraded easy to setup easy to use,always cheapest diverse media streamers got one way memory better ghz wifi usb port external media feature love lost remote finder sounds choice three loud sounds remote glad upgraded easy setup easy use,alway cheapest divers media streamer got one way memori better ghz wifi usb port extern media featur love lost remot finder sound choic three loud sound remot glad upgrad easi setup easi use

years ago for my folks and all it did was buffer nonstop when i tried to watch any streaming service on it it drove me mad and i ended up just giving it to a sibling who actually has no problems with it working for them haha still i ve owned roku devices since they first launched and have always really liked and appreciated their simplicity for the most part and how well they worked for be in the past so reading the specs on this latest model specifically the better wifi connectivity that this ultra claimed well i thought i d chance buying it even though it was pricey and after having set up this ultra and after i tried out all my streaming services that i subscribe to on it i have to say that i couldn t be happier and couldn t be more impressed with how wonderfully this latest model functions for me i completely expect to have buffering issues at some point just because any streaming service will give you them eventually in my opinion yet as far as the actual roku being able to properly connect to my home s wifi network well this model just works flawlessly i believe i totally am convinced of and believe the advertised increased better wifi connectivity to me it s awesome when a product that i buy actually lives up the manufacturers claims woohoo plus i haven t used a newer roku in a while and i really am digging all the new features and functions i haven t tried the voice assist stuff yet but i d be surprised if it didn t work flawlessly as well i also want to say just how grateful i am that roku has continued to keep the overall aesthetics of the device to be very simplistic clean looking not cluttered and just super easy to understand especially for both my folks i set everything up for my parents but they were able to learn to how use this roku very quickly with not too much instruction they are both almost which isn t really that old in my opinion and they are both sharp as heck it s just that they didn t grow up using tech stuff like i did so it can be more confusing for them to learn these devices sometimes i ve done that s one of the reasons i ve always adored rokus though because pretty much anybody can get up to speed in using the device efficiently in no time at all in my opinion also when initially downloading all my streaming service apps and looking at the sign in functions i was at the start concerned that i might have issues signing into services such as hbo max starz and showtime anytime with my directtv credentials but that worry was all for nothing i gladly found out p it didn t look like that i would be able to access a cable satellite provider option from within the respective apps on the roku itself and sign in that way but once i just clicked log in i was able to use my phone from there input the given codes and sign up on the internet at the service s websites and from there they each offered the cable satellite provider feature i needed i m super happy and thankful it all worked out well for me with that potential issue i should also say that if you ve never used a roku before that the fact they use such an infinitesimal small amount of electricity to stay always on the roku doesn t have a shut off function that i just forgot how awesome it is to have everything you might use already loaded up and ready to go because the device is always on and there is seriously very little wait time to load any applications on the roku that feature will never get old as far as i m concerned so i of course cannot speak to how well this new roku ultra will work for everyone else who buys and uses one but as far my use has gone and as i said in my review title i m ultra impressed with this latest model so much so that i believe i will purchase a second one for myself pretty soon i hope my

793,793,R2ZJ4YHHQ12FI5,Customer Support At Roku Is Non-Existent...,"I have been a Roku customer since they started business. Our Roku Ultra started having ""issues"" about three months after we got it. If you fast forwarded or backed up, the unit would glitch and totally shut down whatever app you were watching, requiring a re-boot of the app and re-opening whatever you were watching. No fun. Finally, one day the Roku went dark. After ten days of Roku ""support,"" they issued a recall tag and we had to pay to ship the unit back to Roku. About 10 days after mailing, we got a brand new Roku Ultra which I excitedly set up. During the set-up, the Roku has to send you and e-mail to verify your e-mail and your customer status. My Ultra would not send the e-mail. This is a known issue with the Ultra and if the e-mail is never sent, the Roku is stuck in the set-up mode, forever. After EIGHT WEEKS, I finally got Roku to issue a return for the replacement Roku that would not set up. The new one arrived and had the same issue. Same with a Roku stick I bought for the guest bedroom. Just returned it to Amazon. after almost two weeks, Roku Support has not reached out to me with any ideas as to why my replacement Ultra won't trigger the set-up e-mail. Depressing how poor Roku support is. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Support is essential. Roku's normally boot up and initialize their set-up routines without a problem. When they fail, they are useless pieces of hardware. Roku has dropped the ball on this version and after two that have failed, I cannot recommend this unit to anyone.

804,804,R2CT1QEWMRY9BP,Highly Competent Streaming Player with All the Options,"Its everything I could have expected, a highly competent streaming player with all the options. We're definitely power users at my house. This has an extra powerful Wi-Fi if you are going to stay wireless, and also supports wired ethernet without an extra dongle (FireTV), if you've wired your house with CAT 6 ethernet like me :) . I already have a 4K TV with LG OS, a FireTV stick, and even a Tivo Romio Pro that streams. When my LG TV, FireTV, & Tivo use Wi-Fi they spend noticeably more time opening apps and opening shows than when connected via wired. With this Roku, the Wi-Fi seems nearly no different. I still connected it via Ethernet in the end, but was surprised how equivalent Wi-Fi seemed compared to my past experiences. Its hardware is fast and reliable, such that I've never perceived a delay induced by the hardware. Easy to configure out of the box too. The menus and channels are really easy to navigate, and easy on my eyes. And it supports seemingly all relevant audio and video formats like Dolby Vision & Dolby Atmos, which it audio-detects level of HDR support in your TV. The remote is probably is probably its most multi-faceted and yet simple and intuitive solution. It has volume buttons or mute on the right side by your thumb. it has a headphone jack on the left for silent watching if you don't want to disturb others. It is an RF remote meaning you can tuck the Roku away in a cabinet or behind a TV and it will still work without line-of-sight. But the Roku does have an IR sensor if you have another IR remote too. And most of the buttons are what you'd expect on a modern streamer, but feels simple, easy, and intuitive to use. The skip-back button (like my Tivo button) is something I use a lot, such as if I missed something or didn't hear them quite right. Surprisingly by default it displays closed captioning (subtitle) on the replay so you can see what they said if you were backing it up. But you can turn that off CC on rewind if you rewind often and don't want the distraction of text. And the voice-command button and subsequent command processing is surprisingly good. You can even say things like ""skip forward 2 minutes"" or whatever. And you can even save your last voice command in one of the two numbered buttons by holding one after, and then repeats that command if you touch it again. I actually use that a lot to skip for ward 30 seconds :) . However, some possible minor negatives are: (1) There is no 30-second instant skip-forward button on the remote. But you can use a voice command to skip any amount of time you want, including 30-seconds, and can store that in one of the configurable buttons. It just isn't exactly instant skip while it processes the command, but close enough. (2) Pausing and resuming leave the screen darkened and showing the progress bar and controls and takes a few seconds to resume normal brightness of the show or movie. That irks me compared to my LG TV that the back button can hide the bar so I can instantly be back into my show in its full picture. (3) Streaming apps 05 vary by platform, so don't expect them to be identical. For example, I REALLY like the Netflix app on my LG TV for #2 and for fast forwarding that can click right or left through easy picture snapshots rather than a traditional fast forward or rewind that appears in the Roku version of the same app. (4) The volume buttons on the right-side of the remote are easy to accidentally press if you aren't careful, but doesn't really get in the way. (5) If it doesn't detect Dolby Vision, double check that the device it is directly connected to supports it on that HDMI input. Definitely not the fault of this device, but it puzzled me for a while why it didn't detect Dolby Vision at first when my TV supports it (the TV did, but the HDMI input on my Blu-ray player didn't). Roku supports the widest channel library that I am aware of, and is the reason I bought this, for HBO Max. I use this when I want the best sound support to go through my sound system and it delivers a noticeable sound improvement in my home compared to my TV connected back to my A/V receiver. I actually have this plugged into the HDMI In port on my Oppo 4K Blu-ray player.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CT1QEWMRY9BP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,7.0,2021,5,O.S.10.0,i purchased the roku when i was ready to cut the cable and move on from directv i have been nothing but pleased with this device it works equally well on both wifi and an ethernet connection,purchased ready cut cable move directv nothing pleased device works equally well wifi ethernet connection,purchas readi cut cabl move directv noth pleas devic work equal well wifi ethernet connect

806,806,R1KRUR4AHGSNM5,It'll Do,"TL;DR: Fast; clean interface, but still shows ads; voice remote cool, but remote finder button doesn't work; doesn't fully support 5Ghz wireless; doesn't support exFAT. This Roku Ultra 2020 (4800X model) replaces my a 6-year-old Sony BDP-S3500 Streaming Blu-ray Player, which was slow and didn't support a lot of apps (such as HBO). I wanted the Ultra model for the USB port and the speed, and it has both. Apps install and uninstall very quickly and load quickly as well. If an app is still in memory, it loads instantaneously. The menu interface is similar to the simplicity of the Sony, although the Roku does have ads on the home screens, contrary to their 03keting and other literature. However, this seems unavoidable on modern streaming devices so I'll settle for the lesser evil (they don't have sound, at least). I appreciated being able to customize the menu to some extent, and setting the two customizable buttons on the remote was a breeze. The voice control on the remote is also helpful in lieu of typing in searches, but I haven't found it too useful otherwise (it doesn't seem to ""know"" much in terms of functions). The ability to sync it with my TV to control the TV volume and power was very easy and it didn't take long for it to find a right match. The Roku device has a button on the side that is intended to initiate a sound on the remote in order to find it, but this feature does not work. If you check out Roku's support forums, they broke this feature with a software update over a year ago and have yet to fix it. I was only able to get it to work by using the remote to go into the device's settings and use its test function. Obviously, if I'm looking for the remote I won't be able to activate the sound that way. The setup on this device was a pain and took hours, and I'd say I have a reasonable amount of tech experience. For one thing, trying to get it on my 5Ghz wireless network was impossible. For whatever reason, the Roku Ultra was designed to only support some channels and not others (unlike any other wireless device I've ever used, which just works with whatever standard it is supposed to work with). Roku's website indicates you have to go into your wireless router settings (not readily navigable for your average user) and manually set the channel. The problem is, not all routers support manually setting the channel, even in advanced mode (mine does not). My only option was to put the Roku on the slower 2.4GHz network. If your Roku happens to be in close physical proximity to your router, you could use the Ethernet port instead. Then, when I went to test the USB functions on the device, I was utterly baffled that it does not support the most common format for modern external drives, exFAT. Even my outdated Sony player supported that. Their website even acknowledges that ""many new USB drives are pre-formatted with the exFAT file system, which is not supported"". So then, instead of using my normal media USB drive, I had to find an old one I had and format it in NTFS to use it. Since I have video files over 4GB, NTFS is the only option on my Windows 10 computer available that the Roku device supports. My final gripe is that the LED on the front is bright, and not adjustable like it is on some of Roku's other devices via their device menu or secret menu. Black electrical tape over the LED will fix that problem, though (it's not like this device is going to win any design awards anyway).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KRUR4AHGSNM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,3,True,,2021,5,O.S.10.0,optical fiber was added to the neighborhood meaning two choices in internet and television traditional cable from a major corporation known to all or ip based television from the optical company i tried the optical fiber companies ip tv and found it very similar to traditional cable with little choice more expensive and with a worse picture roku saved the day sparkling picture at k with a simply brilliant interface to channel surfing adding sling blue spent a couple hours at the c net top channel guide https www cnet com news hulu vs youtube tv vs sling tv vs at t tv vs philo vs fubotv channels compared table cuts and pastes easily into excel with several of the extras you can add on gave me all my traditional channels less of what i don t care about and smorgasbord of new ones picture quality depends a bit on the specific provider but in general especially on the major channels i care about it beats cable in hindsight i am glad i got this particular version roku ultra because it can be connected via a cat cable to your internet access point no wifi dropouts the remote is very simple to use compared to the multi button ones you usually have to deal with better picture simpler interface less costly roku is the future and available here now today my multi ade non love affair with a major cable corporation has ended,optical fiber added neighborhood meaning two choices internet television traditional cable major corporation known ip based television optical company tried optical fiber companies ip found similar traditional cable little choice expensive worse picture saved day sparkling picture k simply brilliant interface channel surfing adding sling blue spent couple hours c net top channel guide https www cnet com news hulu vs youtube vs sling vs vs philo vs fubotv channels compared table cuts pastes easily excel several extras add gave traditional channels less care smorgasbord new ones picture quality depends bit specific provider general especially major channels care beats cable hindsight glad got particular version ultra connected via cat cable internet access point wifi dropouts remote simple use compared multi button ones usually deal better picture simpler interface less costly future available today multi ade non love affair major cable corporation ended,optic fiber ad neighborhood mean two choic internet televis tradit cabl major corpor known ip base televis optic compani tri optic fiber compani ip found similar tradit cabl littl choic expens wors pictur save day sparkl pictur k simpli brilliant interfac channel surf ad sling blue spent coupl hour c net top channel guid http www cnet com news hulu vs youtub vs sling vs vs philo vs fubotv channel compar tabl cut past easili excel sever extra add gave tradit channel less care smorgasbord new one pictur qualiti depend bit specif provid gener especi major channel care beat cabl hindsight glad got particular version ultra connect via cat cabl internet access point wifi dropout remot simpl use compar multi button one usual deal better pictur simpler interfac less costli futur avail today multi ade non love affair major cabl corpor end

829,829,R2PD31RWY6LIP,Nice upgrade but see review for plex issue.,"Like the old Roku I had, this streams the standard Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ etc without issue. I specifically bought this for the added support on Plex Direct streaming over my old Roku 3. This direct plays everything I throw at it superbly! Wifi is much improved. The new remote is awesome. Voice features and IR volume control are great. The only hiccup I had was that my TV remote started activating the built in CEC to auto switch to the Roku Input. I quickly attributed it to the IR receiver on the Roku. I covered the power LED section with some masking tape I had and it completely resolved the issue. The Roku remote uses Bluetooth so this is a non issue for me. Everything now works as expected. Edit: just encountered a known issue with all late 2020 Ultras. If I direct play a HEVC encoded file through Plex or the media player, the roku misreads it as an HDR file and makes the movie obscenely red. This has been known and unfixed for over 6 months now so I will be returning this player.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PD31RWY6LIP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,4,True,,2021,5,O.S.10.0,i love roku i think it was the best invention,love think best invention,love think best invent

833,833,R2HPZCLD2I922A,Works great with my LG OLED55B8PUA,"I've been using the Roku Ultra 2020 with my LG OLED55B8PUA for a week now and I'm very pleased with the excellent picture quality . My pri03y reason for purchasing the Roku was to watch HBO Max on my 4K HDR LG TV (LG TVs don't have an HBO Max app). HBO Max comes in beautifully on the Roku, as does Disney Plus and Amazon Prime. All three of these services provide 4K HDR streaming and the picture quality is equivalent to watching a 4K UHD disc. In fact, I watched ""Avatar"" on Disney Plus a few days ago and I could swear I was watching a 4K UHD version of it. As far as I know, this film has not been released in 4K UHD yet. The presentation on Disney Plus via the Roku was noticeably better than the upscaled version of the Full HD 1920x1080 Blu-Ray disc playing through my Sony 4K UHD standalone player. I know that Disney Plus varies their streaming bitrate based on demand, so I 05 have just been fortunate to have watched ""Avatar"" when it was streaming at the max bitrate. A few months ago in the middle of the pandemic, I tried watching it and I thought I was watching the DVD version. As far as installation goes, it went smoothly except for the step where the Roku attempts to recognize the TV being used. It could not recognize my TV as a 4K HDR TV. All I had to do was press the ""down"" arrow on the remote to select the 4K HDR TV option before pressing the ""enter"" button, but I neglected to do that and it kept selecting the ""720p HD TV"" option (the default). My user error.

because i like the simple interface however i didn t use roku on my new lg tv at first because most of the streaming apps are built into the tv itself except for hbo so i started using my old roku i then ided to upgrade the roku to take advantage of the k monitor and to upgrade the wireless connectivity but i had to return the unit because it caused instability in my home theater ecosystem the problems first and foremost the roku device could not detect my ghz wifi network so i had to settle for the slower ghz network one would think that in the time between the roku and this x the wireless capabilities would have improved i later got a replacement unit that detected and connected to the ghz network without issue so it must have been that particular unit the second and biggest problem was that the stable arc connection i had between my lg oled cxpua and denon avrs bt devices broke when the roku ultra was plugged into either the tv itself or the avr while the tv could detect the avr it could no longer control it or even output sound to it even after disconnecting the roku ultra from the system the tv and avr could not reestablish a link until either the tv was reset to factory or i played with the arc settings to break and re negotiate a connection after re establishing arc with the roku ultra disconnected plugging it into either the tv itself or into the denon once again resulted in error free audio for a few seconds until the roku seemingly corrupted the link between the tv and avr and the tv switched to internal speakers this switchover occurred sometimes in realtime and sometimes after power cycling the tv and avr the only reliable way to resolve this is to disconnect the offending roku device disable the arc support on the avr restart the tv and avr re enable the arc on the avr sometimes reset the tv to factory settings often this isn t necessary i reached out to roku lg and denon s customer support a second roku ultra x caused the same issue lg sent out a repairman to replace the tv s internals which did not resolve the issue denon support surmised that there was a strange handshake issue at play but have no way of resolving it this is the only lucid explanation i received and sounds correct to me as if the roku was forcing the tv into using earc or some other communication settings that the denon doesn t support i doubt either of these are the true explanation though arc is a standard right right roku support tried to explain to me how to insert an hdmi cable me there s nothing wrong with these hdmi cables i m using unless roku supplied an incompatible cable or there s some way they can be inserted wrong an obvious joke as the cables are not only keyed but would not have produced any audio or video in the first place let alone a functioning arc connection roku support let me explain something to you really guy it s not rocket surgery so the roku has been replaced with no change in behavior the guts of the tv have been replaced with no change in behavior and the only remaining piece is a receiver i m just going to stick with the roku for now because the image gets upscaled by the receiver anyway and the quality difference isn t that bad and the roku works perfectly with the existing arc connection the only real benefit to the roku ultra is that the remote works with the roku gives me the ability to power on off all the devices and lets me control the sound that s one expensive remote upgrade though,using various devices least years like simple interface however use new lg first streaming apps built

Then Audio issues - only audio from Roku was distorted and breaking up - all other devices no problems. I checked cables, swapped HDMI ports - still bad audio. I went into Roku audio settings and changed audio stream to 'passthrough' instead of the Roku automatically selecting correct setting. Problem solved!! Obviously the Roku can NOT automatically 12ipher correct video nor audio. begin original review *********** Was having some dropout issues with video and even an HDCP error from time to time. Also Roku would not pass signal through my receiver's passive mode (video to TV but not using home theater surround).

I went into Roku setup and experimented with some of the 4K settings for the TV and no longer have a drop out and the Roku now works passively with my home theater's passive mode that I use when just casually watching TV without full blown surround sound.

865,865,R2V1K4KGFRJ01N,Ultra Impressed,"I bought a Roku Ultra a few years ago for my folks and all it did was buffer nonstop when I tried to watch any streaming service on it. It drove me mad and I ended up just giving it to a sibling, who actually has no problems with it working for them, haha. Still, I’ve owned Roku devices since they first launched and have always really liked and appreciated their simplicity for the most part and how well they worked for be in the past. So, reading the specs on this latest model, specifically the “50% better WiFi connectivity” that this ultra claimed, well, I thought I’d chance buying it even though it was pricey. And, after having set up this Ultra and after I tried out all my streaming services that I subscribe to on it. I have to say that I couldn’t be happier and couldn’t be more impressed with how wonderfully this latest model functions for me. I completely expect to have buffering issues at some point just because any streaming service will give you them eventually in my opinion. Yet, as far as the actual Roku being able to properly connect to my home’s WiFi network. Well, this model just works flawlessly I believe. I totally am convinced of and believe the advertised, increased, 50% better WiFi connectivity. To me it’s awesome when a product that I buy actually lives up the manufacturers claims :). Woohoo! Plus, I haven’t used a newer Roku in a while and I really am digging all the new features and functions. I haven’t tried the Voice Assist stuff yet but I’d be surprised if it didn’t work flawlessly as well. I also want to say just how grateful I am that Roku has continued to keep the overall aesthetics of the device to be very simplistic, clean looking, not cluttered and just super easy to understand, especially for both my folks. I set everything up for my parents but they were able to learn to how use this Roku very quickly with not too much instruction. They are both almost 70. Which isn’t really that old in my opinion and they are both sharp as heck. It’s just that they didn’t grow up using tech stuff like I did so it can be more confusing for them to learn these devices sometimes I’ve done. That’s one of the reasons I’ve always adored Rokus, though, because pretty much anybody can get up to speed in using the device efficiently in no time at all in my opinion. Also, when initially downloading all my streaming service apps and looking at the sign in functions. I was at the start concerned that I might have issues signing into services such as HBO Max, STARZ and Showtime Anytime with my DirectTV credentials. But, that worry was all for nothing I gladly found out :P. It didn’t look like that I would be able to access a “cable/satellite provider” option from within the respective apps on the Roku itself and sign in that way. But once I just clicked LOG IN I was able to use my phone from there, input the given codes and sign up on the internet at the service’s websites and from there they each offered the cable/satellite provider feature I needed. I’m super happy and thankful it all worked out well for me with that potential issue. I should also say that if you’ve never used a Roku before. That, the fact they use such an infinitesimal small amount of electricity to stay always on (the Roku doesn’t have a shut off function.) That I just forgot how awesome it is to have everything you might use already loaded up and ready to go because the device is always on and there is seriously very little wait time to load any applications on the Roku.

897,897,R166CCGY4KD99L,Roku 12ides which apps you get to use,"I put Roku sticks on all of my Samsung ""s03t"" TVs because I was sick of dealing with slow updates and lack of apps. My apps on Roku are kept up to date, but they still don't get all the features that Android TV devices get. I have 5 Rokus, an Amazon Fire Stick, TiVo Stream, Apple TV, and Chromecast. I went with all Roku because their apps are the most up to date and the user interface is easy. After playing around with the Fire Stick and TiVo (both Android), I've found that those apps are just as up to date or more and I can side load any app I want. Roku and YouTube are in a heated battle right now and it looks like Roku might block YouTube because they can't come to an agreement. I don't want a device that leverages its large user base to force providers into contracts. I'm not a fan of the user interfaces on TiVo or Fire Stick, but at least they don't block me from side loading apps that aren't in the app stores. My advice to you is to find a pure Android TV device. They aren't locked down to weird interfaces like Amazon & TiVo and they won't ever block you from putting any app you want on them. They might cost a little more up front because they aren't making more off of you with tons of ads, but in the long run, they don't play politics and they don't have a say in which apps you get to have access to. I'll try to remember to update this when I find a good Android device.

899,899,R2LE0MN67A8I2F,Works great so far! Almost perfect for what we needed.,"After seeing how my cable bill was going up and up, I 12ided to cut the cable and get a Roku. It streams everything we watch and there is usually a way to find anything that you want to watch on some channel somewhere. We already had most of the streaming systems like netflix and hulu so we only needed to find a couple channels that were watched by the family on cable. We found them under the Roku channel and Frndly so we no longer needed cable. It works great and is very fast loading from channel to channel. Video quality is great and haven't had any issues with it. The menu is VERY easy to use and you can always just hit the home button to go back to the main menu. My ONLY complaint is it does turn the tv on and off, but if you have it set up with a stereo for surround, you still have to use that remote for power and volume. Would be nice if they made it more like a universal remote to work with stereos. One button power for your equipment and then volume. 05be in the next model?!?! *Hint Hint Roku!!*",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LE0MN67A8I2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,,2021,5,O.S.10.0,fabulous product works so well we bought a second one for our rv absolutely the best,fabulous product works well bought second one rv absolutely best,fabul product work well bought second one rv absolut best

902,902,R1CUTEN3CHR488,Great for Cord Cutters,"Optical fiber was added to the neighborhood meaning two choices in Internet and television, traditional cable from a major corporation known to all, or IP-based television from the optical company. I tried the optical fiber companies IP TV and found it very similar to traditional cable with little choice, more expensive and with a worse picture. Roku saved the day. Sparkling picture at 4K with a simply brilliant interface to channel surfing. Adding Sling Blue (spent a couple hours at the c|net top 100 channel guide https://www.cnet.com/news/hulu-vs-youtube-tv-vs-sling-tv-vs-at-t-tv-vs-philo-vs-fubotv-100-channels-compared/ <- table cuts and pastes easily into Excel), with several of the extras you can add-on, gave me all my traditional channels, less of what I don't care about and smorgasbord of new ones. Picture quality depends a bit on the specific provider, but in general, especially on the major channels I care about, it beats cable. In hindsight, I am glad I got this particular version (Roku Ultra 2020) because it can be connected via a Cat6 cable to your Internet Access point - no WiFi dropouts. The remote is very simple to use compared to the multi-button ones you usually have to deal with. Better picture, simpler interface, less costly - Roku is the future and available here, now, today.

925,925,R12T1V5M5GBTS9,No longer works with new YouTube TV subscriptions (as of 5/1/21),"Overall, I liked the look and ease of set up of the Roku Ultra. It was simple and fast. I did not like the fact that I needed to create a ""Roku account"" and provide credit card information to activate the unit. I most likely would have never purchased anything from the account anyway. I bought the unit because our Sony Bravia ""s03t TV"" was not able to receive Apple TV+ content and I thought the Roku sounded like a perfect solution. However, unbeknown to me when I ordered the Roku, there is a rift with Google, and now anyone buying a new Roku device cannot access their YouTube TV streaming service. The ""regular"" YouTube app still works, however. The YouTube TV app is not even available anymore for new Roku users. Apparently existing Roku users that are getting YouTube TV 05 also soon be cut off if an agreement cannot be reached between Google (YouTube TV) and Roku. Each one points a finger at the other, but because we rely on YouTube TV for most of our programming after cutting the cable TV cord, any device that will not support YouTube TV is a non-starter. So I returned the Roku Ultra and in Amazon's usual fantastic customer service oriented fashion, there was no problem in doing so. I just wish this information had been available before I ordered the Roku in the first place, but apparently this is a fairly recent development.

938,938,R291EQR86QKG86,Breaks ARC connection between LG TV and Denon AVR,"I've been using various Roku devices for at least 10 years because I like the simple interface. However, I didn't use Roku on my new LG TV at first because most of the streaming apps are built into the TV itself - except for HBO, so I started using my old Roku 3. I then 12ided to upgrade the Roku 3 to take advantage of the 4k monitor and to upgrade the wireless connectivity, but I had to return the unit because it caused instability in my home theater ecosystem. The problems: First and foremost, the Roku device could not detect my 5Ghz wifi network, so I had to settle for the slower 2.4Ghz network. One would think that in the time between the Roku 3 and this 4800X the wireless capabilities would have improved. (I later got a replacement unit that detected and connected to the 5Ghz network without issue - so it must have been that particular unit) The second and biggest problem was that the stable ARC connection I had between my LG OLED65CXPUA and Denon AVRS530BT devices broke when the Roku Ultra was plugged into either the TV itself or the AVR. While the TV could detect the AVR, it could no longer control it or even output sound to it. Even after disconnecting the Roku Ultra from the system, the TV and AVR could not reestablish a link until either the TV was reset to factory or I played with the ARC settings to break and re-negotiate a connection. After re-establishing ARC with the Roku Ultra disconnected, plugging it into either the TV itself or into the Denon once again resulted in error-free audio for a few seconds until the Roku (seemingly) corrupted the link between the TV and AVR, and the TV switched to Internal Speakers. This switchover occurred sometimes in realtime, and sometimes after power cycling the TV and AVR. The only reliable way to resolve this is to 1) disconnect the offending Roku device 2) disable the ARC support on the AVR 3) restart the TV and AVR 4) re-enable the ARC on the AVR 5) *Sometimes* reset the TV to factory settings. Often this isn't necessary. I reached out to Roku, LG, and Denon's customer support. - A second Roku Ultra 6800X caused the same issue. - LG sent out a repairman to replace the TV's internals, which did not resolve the issue. - Denon support surmised that there was a strange handshake issue at play, but have no way of resolving it. This is the only lucid explanation I received and sounds correct to me - as if the Roku was forcing the TV into using eARC or some other communication settings that the Denon doesn't support (I doubt either of these are the true explanation though - ARC is a standard, right? Right??) - Roku support tried to explain to me how to insert an HDMI cable. ME: ""There's nothing wrong with these HDMI cables I'm using, unless Roku supplied an incompatible cable or there's some way they can be inserted wrong"" (an obvious joke as the cables are not only keyed, but would not have produced any audio or video in the first place, let alone a functioning ARC connection) ROKU Support: ""Let me explain something to you..."" Really, guy? It's not rocket surgery. So, the Roku has been replaced with no change in behavior, the guts of the TV have been replaced with no change in behavior, and the only remaining piece is a $200-400 receiver. I'm just going to stick with the Roku 3 for now, because the image gets upscaled by the receiver anyway, and the quality difference isn't *that* bad ... and the Roku 3 works perfectly with the existing ARC connection. The only real benefit to the Roku Ultra is that the remote works with the Roku 3, gives me the ability to power on/off all the devices, and lets me control the sound.

957,957,RCQSFS8ZS2LB2,A great media streamer.,"Great piece of tech from Roku. Hooks up easily. Set up went pretty well, except for a confusing pop up that said my connection could not play 4K HDR, when all my hardware will absolutely do just that. There was an option to force it and it took, so all is good, but puzzling why that pop up appeared. Great picture and sound. Provides all the latest features, such as Dolby Vison, Atmost, etc. So many options and channel apps. Nice not to have to have a streamer cater to one provider, such as Apple. Pretty easy to navigate thru the Home and settings page with the remote. Love the feature that helps you find a lost remote. This is one of the few media streamers that offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature. I'm able to plug my USB thumb drive into it and watch videos or photos. I wish every media streamer offered this. It's the main reason I changed from an Amazon 4K firestick to this Roku. The one big thing that I have to ding Roku for is the very poor placement of the mute button on the right side of the remote. I continually hit this mute button accidently with the middle part of my thumb while using the remote, especially when using the volume control above it. Very annoying. The mute button should be on the front of the remote or higher up the right side of the remote, above the main volume control. That is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.

eliminate the lag that comes from introducing bluetooth into the mix you are setting yourself up for a lousy experience it was so easy to use i moved the device to our living room tv so we weren t using the ps for streaming services any more this device makes watching what you want to a breeze i then made the mistake of buying the roku premier because i mistakenly thought that all i would lose is the headphone jack on the remote after using the ultra i hated the premier the user experience with the ultra is far superior compared to the premier things i like about the ultra it turns on off

volume headphones jack on the remote for private listening the premier gives you the same k capabilities and the same channels etc but the features i mentioned above just make for a much better user experience each of those points by themselves is a damn big deal put together it makes the premier a product that should not have been made i noticed that the folks who are leaving negative reviews generally have some particular exceptional condition in there setup that they can t get around or makes thier user experience less than stellar but for a majority of users out there this product will

995,995,REXIBWRGVNGF7,Roku is Perfect,"Extremely simple to setup and having a Ethernet connection is icing on the cake. The remote ear phone Jack works great. I would recommend this Roku device to anyone. Update 05 1,2021 I had a few issues with the Roku Channel, which was resolved because of Roku’s Customer Service response. It was almost immediate and their follow up messages to insure the issue was resolved was great.

996,996,R5LWX1OWWFWNH,"Great interface and setup is easy, works great with Dolby Atmos Home Theater",The Roku ultra works great. I love how the remote automatically works with my home theater receiver. I didn't have to do anything special for it to see and transmit in Dolby Atmos. These are some of the best designed remote controls and the software is easy to use. I immediately noticed the upgraded quality over the more inexpensive Roku (better picture and sound quality). The menus are snappy and everything just works the way it should.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5LWX1OWWFWNH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,True,2.0,2021,4,O.S.10.0,i reviewed the product on youtube and took the plunge to purchase this device what a great streaming device and performs perfectly all the function i needed using on my wireless router with no picture or audio lag best device i purchase this year and possibly last year,reviewed product youtube took plunge purchase device great streaming device performs perfectly function needed using wireless router picture audio lag best device purchase year possibly last year,review product youtub took plung purchas devic great stream devic perform perfectli function need use wireless router pictur audio lag best devic purchas year possibl last year

1002,1002,R1QL3D66LIFOYX,Fragile and overheats,"The ultra overheats. I have to turn it off every night or it will blink in and out during streams. This morning, it started to black screen every 20 seconds and finally froze completely with house temperature at 77! The remote is fragile and died after 2 drops from 2 ft up. The stream has never delivered Dolby HDR, or any HDR signal. My native TV Netflix App does Dolby Vision so I can compare the Ultra directly. Do not recommend. Get the Premiere. It is on am 1 Amp circuit so never overheats. It also delivers basic HDR.

1004,1004,R46RJW2XQOCO4,Best streaming player for the price,"Got the Ultra for my mom after she complained endlessly about the Fire TV Stick, and it was worth it 100%. The Fire TV Stick had ads everywhere, lagged constantly, and was a pain to use for daily streaming. The Roku Ultra, on the other hand, is a breeze to use. Clean interface (one non-intrusive ad on the Home Screen), powerful features, and we’ve experienced zero lag in watching anything. Not to mention the private listening through Bluetooth or the remote. Haven’t tried other Roku products, but if they’re anything like the Ultra I’m pretty much sold on their superiority.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R46RJW2XQOCO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G9TJWW9,5,False,,2021,4,O.S.10.0,this little thing packs a powerful punch quick response in all applications and the home screen k and dolby atmos is a huge plus,little thing packs powerful punch quick response applications home screen k dolby atmos huge plus,littl thing pack power punch quick respons applic home screen k dolbi atmo huge plu
