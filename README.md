# NLP Final Group Project: ROKU Product Review Using Text Analysis


This repo contains the codes we used for the Roku product analysis. 
We analyzed customers' opinions on different Roku versions using Tweets and Amazon customer reviews. To collect the necessary data, we web-scrapped using Twitter's and Amazon's Rainforest API.


`saving_tweets_.py`: codes used for extracting tweets <br /> 
`lda_attempt_roku_.py` : codes used for topic modelling <br /> 
`senti_analysis.py`: codes used for sentiment analysis <br /> 


We then performed the topic modelling to extract popular topics from amazon reviews, and conducted the text analysis to identify what users like and dislike about their Roku products. Based on our findings, we provided business suggestions for the next product development.
